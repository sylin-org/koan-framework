# DATA-0070: External ID Correlation Framework

## Executive Summary

Framework-level external ID correlation for Koan Flow entities enables automatic cross-system entity tracking and parent-child resolution.

## Problem Statement

- No automatic external ID population in canonical models.
- No cross-system correlation or indexed parent-child resolution.

## Solution

- Populate identifier.external.{source}:{id} in canonical projections.
- Create indexed key relationships for parent-child resolution.
- Merge data from different systems under unified canonical entities.
