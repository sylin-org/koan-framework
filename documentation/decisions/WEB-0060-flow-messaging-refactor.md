# WEB-0060: Flow Messaging Refactor

## Objective

Implement clean Flow messaging architecture at the Koan.Messaging/Koan.Flow framework level for improved developer experience and maintainability.

## Architectural Improvements

- AsyncLocal FlowContext for adapter identity.
- MessagingInterceptors for type-safe registration.
- entity.Send() pattern for natural developer surface.
- Consistent message handling via TransportEnvelope and MessagingTransformers.

## Rationale

Addresses lost adapter context, complex auto-handler magic, poor developer experience, and inconsistency with Koan patterns.
