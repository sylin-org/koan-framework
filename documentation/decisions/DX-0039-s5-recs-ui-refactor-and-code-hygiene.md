title: DX-0039 - S5.Recs UI refactor and code hygiene
---

## Context

S5.Recs (recommendations sample) shipped a pragmatic, single-file UI (`wwwroot/index.html`) with inline handlers, global state, and duplicated render logic for grid vs. list cards. The UX request introduced three concrete changes:

- Click-to-detail should be on the image only (not the whole card).
- Reserve the bottom part of the card for interactions (like, dropped, favorite, quick rate).
- Tags should be clickable to add/remove them from the preferred-tags filter.

Additionally, the results page size was increased (24 → 100), which raises mild performance and maintainability concerns in the current structure (heavy `innerHTML`, repeated templates, scattered constants).

This ADR formalizes a small refactor focused on code hygiene, safety, and DX while implementing the requested UX changes.

## Decision

Adopt a lightweight modular structure and UI componentization for S5.Recs’ frontend while preserving its static hosting and zero-build nature:

1. ES module split under `wwwroot/js/` (no bundler required)

- `config.js`: constants and tunables (PAGE_SIZE=100, prefer weight default, max tags) with dynamic merge from `/admin/recs-settings`.
- `api.js`: network layer wrappers (users, tags, recs, rate, library, anime-by-ids) and response normalization.
- `state.js`: UI state (current user, selected tags, caches) and small helpers.
- `cards.js`: card/list renderers and minimal sub-renderers (title, tags, actions, meta, rate picker).
- `filters.js`: filter and sort application (pure functions where possible).
- `tags.js`: preferred-tags UI and interactions.
- `toasts.js`: notification utilities.
- `main.js`: boot/wiring and event delegation.

2. Event delegation over inline handlers

- Remove `onclick="..."` from markup; bind once at container level for: image click (navigate), bottom controls (favorite/watched/dropped/rate), and tag toggles.
- Keep navigation bound to the image container only.

3. Componentize cards; dedupe grid/list

- Single `renderCard(anime, mode)` with layout policy for grid vs. list differences.
- Render actions in the bottom section of the card; image-only triggers navigation.
- Tags render as buttons that toggle the preferred-tags selection.

4. Safety, accessibility, and perf

- Prefer `textContent`/node creation; escape dynamic content when innerHTML is necessary.
- Add keyboard affordances (`role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, Enter/Space to open details).
- Use `loading="lazy"` on images; keep page responsive with PAGE_SIZE=100.

This preserves the sample’s simplicity while aligning with Koan conventions: separation of concerns, no magic values, and predictable structure.

## Scope

In scope

- `samples/S5.Recs/wwwroot/*` frontend only (HTML/JS/CSS).
- UI behavior changes (image-only navigation; bottom interactions; tag toggles).
- Constants centralization and minimal module split (plain ES modules).

Out of scope

- Backend controllers/services and contracts (no changes required).
- Build tooling (no bundlers). Optional: add ESLint/Prettier for JS only.

## Consequences

Positive

- Better maintainability and testability (modular code, single rendering pathway).
- Safer DOM updates (escape helpers), improved accessibility and keyboard support.
- Clearer separation of concerns; constants/options are centralized.

Negative/risks

- Small up-front refactor cost; minor churn in `index.html` script wiring.
- ES modules require modern browsers (acceptable for the sample).

Operational

- With PAGE_SIZE=100, lazy-loading images keeps memory/CPU acceptable; optional progressive render or virtualization if lists grow larger.

## Implementation notes

- Insert a single `<script type="module" src="/js/main.js"></script>` in `index.html` and migrate inline handlers to delegated listeners.
- Keep `mapItemToAnime` in `api.js` or a dedicated mapper to normalize server variation.
- Maintain existing endpoints and payloads; no server changes needed.
- Use a tiny `escapeHtml` helper; prefer node creation for user content (title/synopsis/tags).
- Follow Koan docs: no empty placeholders; avoid duplication; constants in one place.

## Follow-ups

- Extract `details.html` logic into modules and share render helpers with cards.
- Add minimal lint config (ESLint + Prettier) scoped to `wwwroot/js`.
- Add 2–3 small tests for pure functions (sort/filter/mapItemToAnime) using a lightweight runner.
- Consider IntersectionObserver to progressively render for >100 results.
