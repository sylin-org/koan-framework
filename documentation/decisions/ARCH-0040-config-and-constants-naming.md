# ADR: Naming simplification for configuration helper and per-assembly constants

## Context
KoanConfig provided resilient configuration access. Call sites were verbose (Koan.Core.Configuration.KoanConfig.Read). Per-assembly constants were named with long prefixes (e.g., WebSwaggerConstants), which made usage noisy and inconsistent.

## Decision
1) Rename KoanConfig to a static class named Configuration in the Koan.Core namespace. Call sites now use Koan.Core.Configuration.Read/ReadFirst, keeping names short, explicit, and discoverable.
2) Standardize per-assembly constants type name to Constants, relying on namespaces for clarity (e.g., Koan.Web.Swagger.Infrastructure.Constants). No functional behavior changed.

## Consequences
- Simpler call sites and consistent ergonomics across modules.
- Namespaces disambiguate Constants where many assemblies expose one; using-aliases remain an option when needed.
- No shims introduced; all call sites updated.

## Alternatives considered
- using static Koan.Core.Configuration.KoanConfig at call sites. Rejected: scattered file-level imports hide intent; rename is clearer.
- Adding IConfiguration extensions as sugar. Deferred: possible future addition for even shorter ergonomics (cfg.Read(...)).

## Migration notes
- Fully-qualified calls updated from Koan.Core.Configuration.KoanConfig.Read to Koan.Core.Configuration.Read (and similar for ReadFirst and typed overloads).
- Constants classes renamed in Web.Swagger, Web.Transformers, Messaging.Core.
