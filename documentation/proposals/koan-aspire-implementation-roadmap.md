# Koan-Aspire Integration Implementation Roadmap

**Document Type**: IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP
**Target Audience**: Development Teams, Project Managers, Architects
**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Status**: Proposed for Planning

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the phased implementation approach for integrating Koan Framework with .NET Aspire through distributed resource registration via the existing `KoanAutoRegistrar` pattern.

**Total Estimated Duration**: 8-12 weeks across 4 phases
**Risk Level**: Medium (new integration pattern, dependency on external Microsoft technology)
