## Executive Summary for Review

### Proposed Architecture

**Core Innovation**: Extend existing `KoanAutoRegistrar` pattern with optional `IKoanAspireRegistrar` interface for distributed Aspire resource registration.

```csharp
// Each module self-registers both DI services AND Aspire resources
public sealed class KoanAutoRegistrar : IKoanAutoRegistrar, IKoanAspireRegistrar
{
    public void Initialize(IServiceCollection services) { /* Existing DI */ }
    public void RegisterAspireResources(IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder) { /* NEW: Aspire resources */ }
}
```

### Strategic Value Proposition

**Market Position**: "Enterprise patterns for Aspire development"
- Distributed service ownership (unique in Aspire ecosystem)
- Enhanced provider selection (Docker + Podman + intelligent detection)
- Framework-native integration (Entity-first + auto-registration)
- Multi-deployment flexibility (Compose for local, Aspire for cloud)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Preserve Existing Patterns**: No breaking changes to current Koan functionality
2. **Optional Integration**: IKoanAspireRegistrar is additive, not required
3. **Distributed Registration**: Services self-describe orchestration needs
4. **Enhanced Provider Selection**: Koan intelligence + Aspire runtime support
5. **Hybrid Deployment Strategy**: Multiple export targets for different scenarios
