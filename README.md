# Sora Framework

**Building backend services should feel like playing with Legos, not assembling puzzles with missing pieces.**

Sora is designed to feel natural—like having a conversation with your code rather than wrestling with it. Start with a three-file API, add vector search when you need it, scale to enterprise patterns when you're ready.

## What makes Sora different?

**Start simple, grow smart** — Your first API can be three files. When you need CQRS, messaging, AI, or vector search, they're there—but they don't get in your way until you're ready.

**Familiar, but better** — Controllers work like you expect. Configuration follows .NET conventions. No magic, no surprises—just the good parts of what you already know, refined.

**Batteries included, assembly optional** — Health checks, OpenAPI docs, flexible data access, message handling, and AI integration all work out of the box. Use what you need, ignore the rest.

```csharp
// This is a complete, working API with persistence
using Sora.Web;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddSora();

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseSora();
app.Run();
```

## Why developers choose Sora

🚀 **Zero to API in minutes** — Real CRUD endpoints with just `EntityController<T>`  
🔧 **Escape hatches everywhere** — Drop to raw SQL, custom controllers, or provider-specific features  
📦 **Modular by design** — Add SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, AI providers, or vector search as you grow  
🤖 **AI-ready** — Built-in streaming chat, embeddings, vector search, and RAG patterns  
✅ **Production ready** — Health checks, OpenAPI docs, observability, and message reliability built-in  
🎯 **Predictable** — Convention over configuration, but configuration always wins  

## Core philosophy

- **Start simple, grow smart** — Begin with basics, add complexity only when needed
- **Familiarity first** — Uses patterns you already know (Controllers, DI, EF-style entities)
- **Developer experience** — Clear error messages, helpful defaults, minimal friction
- **Everything is optional** — Data providers, messaging, AI, vector search—add what you need, when you need it

## Real-World Example

```csharp
// Define your model
public class Todo : Entity<Todo>
{
    public string Title { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public bool IsDone { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; } = DateTime.UtcNow;
}

// Get a full REST API
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class TodosController : EntityController<Todo> { }

// Use it naturally
var todo = await new Todo { Title = "Learn Sora" }.Save();
var todos = await Todo.Where(t => !t.IsDone);
```

That's it. You now have:
- `GET /api/todos` — List all todos
- `POST /api/todos` — Create new todo  
- `GET /api/todos/{id}` — Get specific todo
- `PUT /api/todos/{id}` — Update todo
- `DELETE /api/todos/{id}` — Delete todo
- `GET /api/todos/graphql` — GraphQL endpoint (auto-generated)
- Automatic health checks at `/health`
- Interactive OpenAPI docs at `/swagger`

**That's it.** Real data, clean routing, and production patterns—all working.

## Need more? Just add it

**Want AI chat and embeddings?**
```bash
dotnet add package Sora.AI
dotnet add package Sora.Ai.Provider.Ollama
```

Now you have `/ai/chat` with streaming and `/ai/embed` endpoints working with local models.

**Need vector search?**
```bash
dotnet add package Sora.Data.Weaviate
```

Your entities can now be embedded and searched semantically.

**Want reliable messaging?**
```bash
dotnet add package Sora.Messaging.RabbitMq
```

Send messages, handle failures, and process with inbox patterns.

**GraphQL from your REST models?**
```bash
dotnet add package Sora.Web.GraphQl
```

Your `EntityController<T>` now serves both REST and GraphQL automatically.
