/// SEC-0004 (§A) — the built-in per-action gate rung. Looks up the precompiled <see cref="AccessGate"/> for the
/// resource entity type (which already folds in <c>[Access]</c>, lowered legacy floor sugar, and — Slice B — an
/// <c>EntityAccess&lt;T&gt;</c> realization) and evaluates the bag for <see cref="AuthorizeRequest.Action"/>. An
/// OPEN action defers (<c>null</c>) so allow-by-default and higher rungs are preserved; a declared action returns a
/// concrete <see cref="AuthorizeDecision"/>. Registered by default in <c>Koan.Web</c> at <c>Order = 50</c>; richer
/// rungs (RBAC floor, named-policy, PDP/ReBAC) stack around it via <see cref="IAuthorizationProvider"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// At the coarse gate no row is loaded (the resource is the entity <see cref="Type"/>), so an <c>owner</c> term
/// degrades to <c>authenticated</c> — "signed in, so they might own some row." Slice B's Constrain narrows the
/// actual rows; Slice C's per-row projection re-evaluates ownership per item. This keeps the gate from 403-ing a
/// legitimate owner before we know which rows they own (the inverse of the "rules are not filters" footgun).
