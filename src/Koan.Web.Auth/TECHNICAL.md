# Sylin.Koan.Web.Auth — technical contract

## Ownership

Web Auth owns one host-level authentication plan. Connector modules register immutable `AuthProviderDefinition`
values; application configuration overlays those defaults; `AuthProviderPlan` compiles availability, eligibility,
priority, correction, and default election once. The same plan drives scheme seeding, controllers, startup reporting,
composition facts, and the credential-free `IAuthProviderCatalog` projection.

Cross-module contracts live in inert `Sylin.Koan.Web.Auth.Abstractions`. Optional modules must reference that assembly
directly instead of depending on functional Web Auth merely to consume a contract.

## Provider rules

- A connector definition is inactive until its provider has explicit configuration, unless the definition declares an
  automatic local provider.
- Explicit configuration outranks automatic providers; then priority and stable provider ID break ties.
- `PreferredProviderId` is required intent: unknown, disabled, unavailable, or incomplete targets stop startup.
- Configuration-only provider IDs are supported because OAuth2/OIDC mechanics belong to Web Auth itself.
- Required OIDC values: `Authority`, `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`.
- Required OAuth2 values: `AuthorizationEndpoint`, `TokenEndpoint`, `UserInfoEndpoint`, `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`.

Provider callbacks use `/auth/{id}/callback`. Relative endpoints and authorities are reserved for the self-hosted local
test provider; deployment providers should use absolute HTTPS endpoints.

The local relative OIDC authority is projected as one logical provider with separate transport addresses: the live
request supplies its public issuer/authorization origin, while `IServerAddressesFeature` supplies its internal
back-channel origin. If neither a bound address nor a loopback public origin is available, challenge fails with a
correction naming the required Kestrel binding instead of attempting an unreachable public hostname.

## Runtime behavior

`AuthModule.Start` resolves the immutable plan and seeds one ASP.NET scheme per eligible provider. OIDC uses
`OpenIdConnectHandler`; OAuth2 uses `OAuthHandler<OAuthOptions>`. PKCE, state, correlation, OIDC nonce, issuer,
audience, and signature validation remain owned by maintained ASP.NET handlers.

The framework cookie scheme is `Koan.cookie`. Challenge and access-denied responses pass through the discovered
`IKoanAuthFlowHandler` pipeline. JSON/API requests receive the built-in JSON challenge behavior; interactive requests
redirect to the elected provider when one exists.

## Lifecycle failure semantics

- bootstrap, sign-in, challenge, and access-denied exceptions propagate;
- validation exceptions reject the principal and are logged;
- an explicit sign-in rejection prevents cookie issuance;
- external identity linkage completes before sign-in and fails closed;
- sign-out handler failures are logged and local sign-out continues.

Handlers are scoped, auto-discovered implementations of `IKoanAuthFlowHandler`, ordered by `Priority` and then full
type name. Implement only the events the module owns; no DI registration is required.

## Inspectability

Startup logs include total providers, eligible providers, default ID, and election reason. Composition facts expose one
observation per provider plus the default election receipt. `IAuthProviderCatalog` deliberately excludes credentials.
The public discovery route returns eligible providers only.

## Unsupported and deferred

- no SAML handler;
- no automatic secret-vault reference resolution;
- no built-in provider-token persistence or refresh-token API for calling third-party APIs;
- no claim that a provider console, callback URI, consent policy, or tenant allow-list can be inferred by Koan.

The embedded authorization server has its own package and contract.
