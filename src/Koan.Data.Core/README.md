# Sylin.Koan.Data.Core

Data access core for Koan: common primitives, options, and helpers used by relational/document/vector providers and apps.

- Target framework: net10.0
- License: Apache-2.0

## Capabilities

- Entity contracts and helpers for aggregate storage
- Options and conventions shared across data adapters
- Data-owned adapter option binding for readiness and default paging
- Immutable named-source lifecycle/access policy enforced before readiness or provider work
- Separate host-owned reachability, declared-shape validation, and authorized provisioning stages
- Source-only inspection and registered reads without an Entity repository shim
- Bounded provider-neutral `RecordSet` materialization and compiled ordinal DTO projection
- Compact provider-neutral aggregate mapping with host-scoped compiled plans and shared physical encodings
- Selection-aware health semantics for data connectors
- Support for paging, streaming, and batching semantics (see references)

## Install (minimal setup)

```powershell
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Core
```

## Usage - quick examples

- Prefer first-class model statics for top-level data access in your app models:
  - `Item.All(ct)`
  - `Item.Query(predicate, ct)`
  - `Item.FirstPage(size, ct)` and `Item.Page(pageNumber, pageSize, ct)`
  - `Item.QueryStream(predicate, ct)`
- `AllStream`/`QueryStream` lazily compose numbered pages only when the selected adapter proves provider-bounded
  paging and complete ordering. Otherwise they reject correctively before query/yield; there is no materializing
  fallback. `batchSize` bounds Koan-visible candidates, not opaque driver buffers. No public cursor or resume-token
  API exists.
- If a first-class static isn’t available, you can fall back to the generic facade (second-class): `Data<TEntity, TKey>.Query(...)`.

Host-owned persistence policy composes beside the normal zero-configuration bootstrap:

```csharp
services.AddKoan(() =>
    Item.Lifecycle.BeforeUpsert(context =>
        context.Current.Price < 0
            ? context.Cancel("Price cannot be negative.", "item.price")
            : context.Proceed()));
```

The same Lifecycle boundary governs Entity/Data calls and generated REST/MCP entity operations. See
`/docs/reference/data/entity-lifecycle.md` for phases, bulk/transaction semantics, and deliberate
bypasses.

Use a named source when the application needs to inspect or query an external system without adopting Entity
persistence. The connector supplies the final native binding leaf; the application declares the business name,
parameters, lane, and bounds once:

```csharp
services.AddKoan(koan =>
{
    koan.Data.Source("LegacyErp")
        .Query("orders.recent", query => query
            .Lane("Reports")
            .Sql("select ... where CREATED_UTC >= @since")
            .Parameter<DateTimeOffset>("since")
            .MaxRecords(500));
});

var source = Data.Source("LegacyErp");
var description = source.Describe();
var explanation = source.Explain("orders.recent");
var diagnosis = await source.Doctor(ct);
var recent = await source.Query("orders.recent", new { since }, ct);
var orders = recent.Project<RecentOrder>();
var containers = await source.Inspect().Containers(50, ct: ct);
```

The runtime call cannot change the provider payload, source, or read lane. Opaque bindings require a
provider-enforced read lane. Inspection uses neutral containers rather than schemas/tables, and `RecordSet` preserves
duplicate fields, missing/null, nested values, explicit bounds, and honest completion. `Describe` and `Explain` are
pure and never activate a client; `Doctor` is explicit, bounded, non-mutating, and returns stable corrective findings.

Map an Entity to an external record shape in the same source declaration:

```csharp
services.AddKoan(koan =>
{
    koan.Data.Source("LegacyErp").Map<Customer>(map => map
        .Container("dbo", "CUSTOMER")
        .Key(customer => customer.Id).Name("CUSTOMER_NO")
        .Property(customer => customer.Name.Full).Name("DISPLAY_NM")
        .Property(customer => customer.Profile).Object("PROFILE_JSON"));
});
```

`Name` is a scalar physical value, `Object` keeps one logical subtree together, and `Path("NAME_DATA", "full")`
places a flat logical value inside a structured physical value. `Key(...).Parts(...)`, `Generated`, `ReadOnly`, and
`Codec` remain explicit only when needed.

When insert/update distinction matters, ask for it explicitly; ordinary `Save` stays the low-ceremony default:

```csharp
var result = await item.SaveWithOutcome(ct);
// result.Outcome is Inserted or Updated; result.CommitOutcome is Committed.
```

This stronger path is available only when the selected adapter proves exact native mutation outcomes. Bulk writes
prepare the complete Entity set, dispatch once, and reject an inexact affected-count receipt without replay.

Child relationships are strict by default. Native and in-memory providers execute directly; a
scan-backed provider fails with a corrective `RelationshipQueryRejectedException` unless the call
chooses a finite budget:

```csharp
var children = await todo.GetChildren<TodoItem>(
    RelationshipQueryPolicy.Bounded(maxCandidates: 1_000, maxResults: 200), ct);
```

This policy bounds candidates before rows escape and never returns a partial relationship.

Load every declared direct edge with the same `Relatives` operation for one Entity, a finite
selection, or a provider-bounded stream. Model and key types are inferred:

```csharp
var graph = await todo.Relatives(ct);
var graphs = await todos.Where(todo => !todo.IsCompleted).Relatives(ct);

await foreach (var current in Todo.QueryStream(todo => !todo.IsCompleted).Relatives(ct))
{
    // current.Entity, current.Parents, current.Children
}
```

Finite and stream forms preserve source order and multiplicity. Parent edges use batched keyed reads;
child edges retain the same strict or explicitly bounded negotiation and runtime facts as
`GetChildren<TChild>`.

Required Entity/Data operations without a usable Koan host throw `KoanHostContextException`. Its
`Failure`, `Operation`, and `RequiredService` properties distinguish an absent host, a disposed host,
and a host where the Data module was not composed.

`EntityContext` is deliberately Data-specific: it scopes source, adapter, partition, cache, and
transaction routing. It stores that state in Core's logical-flow `KoanContext`, but it is not the
generic API for tenancy, subjects, or other module-owned axes. Those modules own their business-facing
facades and register durable carriage independently through `Koan.Core.Context`.

Named sources default to `Managed + ReadWrite`. Integrate an existing system without granting Koan
shape or data mutation authority by declaring the two independent ceilings once:

```json
{
  "Koan": {
    "Data": {
      "Sources": {
        "LegacyErp": {
          "Adapter": "sqlserver",
          "ConnectionString": "<provider-enforced read-only route>",
          "StorageLifecycle": "External",
          "Access": "ReadOnly"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Entity, batch, instruction, and Direct paths consume the same immutable source plan. `ReadOnly`
blocks data writes; `External` independently blocks create/alter/drop/repair. Forbidden and opaque
effects reject before lifecycle callbacks, readiness, resource creation, or provider I/O. Provider
credentials remain the security boundary.

For a synchronous console process, `new ServiceCollection().StartKoan()` starts a standard .NET
Generic Host and returns its active provider facade. The caller owns it; use
`using var app = (IDisposable)services.StartKoan()` so disposal stops hosted capabilities and releases
the ambient Koan host binding. ASP.NET Core and workers continue to use their native host builder with
`AddKoan()`.

## Boundaries and failures

- Data Core is the Entity runtime and provider-election owner; it does not provide storage by itself. Reference a
  connector or use the JSON floor carried by a Koan entry bundle.
- Its dependency on Cache Abstractions is inert contract vocabulary. Referencing Data Core does not activate caching.
- Stream-shaped Entity APIs run only when the elected provider proves bounded paging. Unsupported providers reject
  before yielding instead of hiding whole-source materialization.
- Query lifecycle callbacks observe only the final visible rows after residual filtering, sort/page completion, and
  projection; discarded provider candidates never escape through Lifecycle.
- Atomic batches and exact per-item outcomes are negotiated execution seams. `RequireAtomic` rejects before deferred
  mutation loads or callbacks when the selected adapter cannot prove it.
- Relationship expansion is direct-edge and budgeted. It is not recursive graph traversal, snapshot isolation, or a
  promise that scan-backed providers can execute without an explicit candidate limit.
- `EntityContext` owns Data routing dimensions only; tenancy, subject, and other semantic axes are contributed and
  enforced by their owning modules.
- Canonical `PatchPayload` is provider-neutral. Web/MCP projections own protocol parsing and normalization before
  the operation reaches Data.
- Required Entity operations without a live composed host throw `KoanHostContextException` with the missing
  operation/service correction.
- A business operation is never treated as a missing-shape probe, provisioned from exception text, and replayed.
  Adapters translate native types/codes through the Data failure-classification seam.
- Registered reads are uncached and never replayed. Unknown effects, missing/unenforced lanes, parameter drift,
  scalar cardinality drift, extra result channels, and active segmentation reject before unsafe exposure.
- Direct typed ADO queries share `RecordSet`'s compiled ordinal projection; they do not serialize dictionaries to JSON.
