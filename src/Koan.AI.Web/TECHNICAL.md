Koan.AI.Web - Technical reference

Contract

- Inputs: HTTP requests to AI endpoints (controller-driven only), validated DTOs.
- Outputs: JSON responses and server-sent events for streaming.
- Success: 2xx with payload; Errors: 4xx for validation/auth, 5xx for provider/runtime.

Architecture

- Expose endpoints via MVC controllers (no inline MapGet/MapPost) per WEB-0035.
- Depends on Koan.AI and Koan.AI.Contracts abstractions; does not couple to a specific provider.
- Authentication/authorization integrates with Koan.Web.Auth when enabled.

Options

- Route bases, response buffering/streaming thresholds, max request size, timeouts.
- CORS and caching policies configured via typed options; no scattered literals (ARCH-0040).

Error modes

- 400: invalid DTO, unsupported model; 401/403: auth failures; 408: timeout; 429: rate limited; 5xx: provider/backing service errors.

Edge cases

- Large payloads; client disconnects mid-stream; slow consumers; SSE retry behavior.
- Concurrency limits and graceful shutdown honoring CancellationToken.

Operations

- Health endpoints and dependency probes; structured logging with correlation id.
- Backpressure via server limits and per-endpoint quotas.
