# Sylin.Koan.Data.Abstractions

Provider-neutral contracts shared by Koan's Entity runtime, data connectors, and modules that need to negotiate data
behavior without activating a provider or host.

Applications normally receive this package through `Sylin.Koan` or `Sylin.Koan.App`. Reference it directly when
implementing a repository/adapter, declaring data capabilities, or consuming the contracts without Data Core.

## Install

```powershell
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Abstractions
```

## Meaningful use

An adapter implements `IDataRepository<TEntity,TKey>` and, when applicable, `IQueryRepository<TEntity,TKey>`.
It advertises only behavior it proves through the shared capability model:

```csharp
var capabilities = DataCaps.Describe(repository, repository.GetType().Name);
var canStreamByPages = capabilities.Has(DataCaps.Query.ProviderBoundedPaging);
```

`QueryDefinition` carries the structured candidate filter, sort, projection, page, partition, and count intent.
`RepositoryQueryResult<TEntity>` reports which axes the provider actually handled. Consumers negotiate those facts;
they do not infer guarantees from an adapter name.

Receipts are executable truth. A result reports handled filter, sort, page, projection, and count work separately;
`CountResult.Execution` distinguishes exact, optimized-exact, and fast/estimate execution. Data rejects an impossible
or incomplete receipt and never replays a dispatched query or mutation to repair one.

Entity mutation contracts follow the same rule:

- `MutationResult<TEntity,TKey>` reports insert, update, delete, missing, or conflict plus commit outcome.
- `BatchResult` reports realized atomicity and, when the created native batch earns
  `CompleteItemOutcomes`, one outcome per builder call in logical call order.
- `RequireAtomic` rejects before deferred loads, Lifecycle callbacks, or provider dispatch unless both the adapter
  claim and the created native execution seam prove atomicity.
- `GetMany` returns exactly one slot per requested identity, preserving order and duplicates and using `null` for
  missing or invisible records.

Adapters also consume one provider-neutral source and failure vocabulary:

- `DataSourcePlan` carries the immutable `StorageLifecycle`, `DataSourceAccess`, route identity, and redacted
  connection identity compiled by Data Core.
- `DataOperationEffect` proves whether dispatch is a read, data write, storage/admin action, or unknown.
- `IDataFailureClassifier` translates native exception types/codes into `DataFailureKind`, `DataCommitOutcome`,
  retry disposition, and replay disposition. Message text is never a classifier. `IDataNativeEvidenceSink` records
  restricted native type/code evidence and returns only an opaque bounded reference to public channels.
- `IAdapterFactory.DescribeClaims` is the inert single declaration for executable capability/profile claims. The
  resulting `DataClaimSet` supplies the exact references used by execution diagnostics and conformance tooling.

Source-only adapters implement `IDataSourceIntegrationFactory`; they do not manufacture an Entity repository.
`IDataSourceInspectorAdapter` supplies bounded, source-bound container inspection, while `IDataSourceIntegration`
executes immutable registered read plans. Both return the same neutral record contracts:

- `RecordSet` preserves field order, duplicate names, missing versus null, nested neutral values, completion, and
  deterministic byte accounting.
- `INeutralRecordReader` converts one provider result channel incrementally; another channel rejects instead of being
  discarded.
- `OperationPlan` keeps effect, result kind, delivery, binding, read lane, parameters, timeout, and bounds independent.
- `IDataSourceNativeInspector` is the only marker admitted by the explicit native-inspection probe; the raw common
  adapter is not exposed as a policy bypass.

Aggregate mapping uses the same provider-neutral posture. `MappingDescriptor` contains one `StorageAddress`, complete
single/composite identity, logical `MappingPath` values, physical `PhysicalPath` locations, value shape, direction,
generation, authority, and optional `IDataMappingCodec`. `MappedRecord` preserves missing versus present-null values,
and `MappingReceipt` identifies the exact compiled plan/bindings used. These contracts contain no SQL column, BSON,
JSON-column, table, or provider SDK type.

The package also owns the canonical provider-neutral `PatchPayload<TKey>` operation. HTTP JSON Patch, Merge Patch,
MCP, or another projection must normalize its protocol into that operation before entering Data.

## Boundaries and failures

- This package is inert vocabulary. It does not register Data Core, elect a provider, open storage, create schemas,
  or expose `Entity<T>` statics.
- It has no ASP.NET Core dependency. Media types, JSON Patch documents, controllers, and HTTP errors belong to Web.
- `ProviderBoundedPaging` promises bounded candidate pages and a complete order, not cursor resumption, snapshot
  isolation, or mutation-safe traversal.
- A provider capability is insufficient without its matching native seam and execution receipt. Stronger behavior
  rejects before work when either half is absent.
- Unsupported optional behavior must reject or negotiate honestly; adapters must not approximate a stronger
  guarantee silently.
- A capability token is a claim, not proof. Provider conformance tests must exercise every advertised behavior.
- Native exception evidence remains adapter-owned and restricted. Data owns the stable public failure kind,
  commit outcome, retry disposition, replay disposition, and safe corrective facts.
