---

## Contract

- This project defines the boundary shared by Data.Core and data adapters. Application-facing
  `Entity<T>` statics live in `Koan.Data.Core`, not here.
- `IDataRepository<TEntity, TKey>` owns key reads, writes, bulk operations, readiness, and repository
  creation semantics.
- `IQueryRepository<TEntity, TKey>` accepts one structured `QueryDefinition` and returns a
  `RepositoryQueryResult<TEntity>` that reports which query axes the provider handled.
- Adapters declare optional behavior through `DataCaps` and the shared `CapabilitySet`; consumers
  negotiate those facts instead of inferring support from a provider name.

## Key types

- `IEntity<TKey>` — the minimal entity identity contract.
- `IDataRepository<TEntity, TKey>` — provider CRUD, bulk, readiness, and batch boundary.
- `IQueryRepository<TEntity, TKey>` — structured query and count execution.
- `QueryDefinition` — filter AST, sort, projection, page, partition, and optional count strategy.
- `RepositoryQueryResult<TEntity>` and `CountResult` — values plus execution/estimate facts.
- `MutationResult<TEntity,TKey>`, `BatchResult`, and `BatchItemResult` — mutation, commit, atomicity, and ordered
  per-operation facts.
- `DataCaps` — query, write, isolation, and retention capability tokens.
- `DataSourcePlan`, `StorageLifecycle`, `DataSourceAccess`, and `DataOperationEffect` — immutable source ceiling
  and exact dispatch-effect vocabulary.
- `DataFailure`, `DataFailureContext`, and `IDataFailureClassifier` — stable public failure/outcome contract and
  the adapter-owned native type/code translation seam.
- `IDataNativeEvidenceSink` — write-only restricted native evidence with an opaque bounded public reference.
- `DataClaimSet`, `IDataClaims`, and `DataCapabilityProfiles` — one inert executable claim projection, including
  source-specific profiles derived from `DataSourceIntegrationDescriptor`, with exact deterministic references
  shared by runtime and TestKit.
- `PatchPayload<TKey>` and `PatchOp` — the provider-neutral patch operation accepted by Data.Core.
- `IFieldTransform`, `IFieldTransformContributor`, and `IFieldTransformInspector` — neutral contracts for
  host-compiled round-trip storage transforms and cross-pillar inspection.
- `IDataSourceIntegrationFactory`, `IDataSourceIntegration`, and `IDataSourceInspectorAdapter` — source-only
  activation, registered reads, and neutral inspection without an Entity repository.
- `StorageAddress`, `StorageContainerReference`, and `StorageContainerDescriptor` — provider-neutral addressing,
  opaque source binding, intrinsic traits, and policy-projected operations.
- `DataField`, `DataRecord`, `RecordSet`, and `RecordSetExecution` — ordered neutral shape/value/completion and
  `MaterializedValueV1` accounting.
- `OperationPlan`, `IDataOperationBinding`, and `BoundOperationParameter` — immutable registered-read decisions and
  provider-native payload seam.
- `MappingDescriptor`, `MappingBindingDescriptor`, `MappingIdentityDescriptor`, `MappingPath`, and `PhysicalPath` —
  inert aggregate-to-record meaning shared by every Family.
- `IDataMappingCodec`, `MappedRecord`, and `MappingReceipt` — one physical encoding, missing-preserving values, and
  exact plan-use evidence for hydration, writes, queries, projections, and indexes.

## Mapping vocabulary

- Logical selection and physical location are separate. A logical path never carries a provider expression, and a
  physical path is an ordered root plus neutral structured segments.
- `Canonical` is the sole writable authority. `Derived` describes a provider-maintained or virtual read expression;
  it cannot enter an ordinary write receipt.
- A writable codec must encode and decode. An explicit read-only binding may use a decode-only codec, but it cannot
  qualify filters, ordering, conditional writes, or indexes that require physical parameter encoding.
- `MappingConvention` is an adapter-supplied managed-store default only. An application-declared map wins; external
  shapes never depend on an adapter silently reinterpreting the fluent grammar.

## Source Integration and neutral records

- A named source resolves an exact `IDataSourceIntegrationFactory`; source-only use never enters the Entity provider
  catalog or constructs a synthetic repository.
- Inspection references and continuations are opaque and source-bound. Data Core validates capability, source,
  descriptor shape, page bounds, and policy-projected operations before returning them.
- Neutral values form a closed algebra. Provider objects, streams, cursors, arbitrary POCOs, and native document types
  convert before `DataRecord` construction, reject, or remain on an explicit native surface.
- A `RecordSet` fixes its shared field shape before the first row. Ordinal access is lossless; exact-case name access
  requires one field; presence bits preserve missing separately from explicit null.
- DTO projection compiles constructor/record or writable-property ordinal reads once per target type per result.
  Direct ADO queries, registered reads, and inspection samples use this same path without dictionary/JSON conversion.
- Registered operations are `Read + Records/Scalar + Buffered`. Opaque bindings require one frozen, provider-enforced
  read lane. Active segmentation rejects unless an explicit host/control-plane surface exists. Calls are uncached and
  never replayed after dispatch.

## Stored-field transform boundary

- A functional module contributes an `IFieldTransformContributor` through standard DI. Data.Core owns compilation,
  ordering, per-type memoization, clone-before-write, and reverse-on-read placement.
- A contributor returns `null` for Entity types it does not affect. Stable contributor ids and order are diagnostic
  and composition inputs, not application configuration.
- `IFieldTransformInspector` lets another pillar make a safe structural decision without referencing the functional
  module. Cache uses it to exclude transformed Entity types; it does not learn Classification internals.
- These contracts do not authorize adapters to apply, omit, or reorder transforms. Supported application paths enter
  through Data.Core; direct repository use is outside that facade guarantee.

## Projection isolation

- This contract assembly does not reference ASP.NET Core or a JSON Patch library.
- HTTP and agent projections parse their native request formats and normalize them to `PatchPayload<TKey>` before
  calling Data. Adapters therefore implement Data semantics without inheriting protocol machinery.
- `PatchPayload<TKey>` is the one Data patch shape; projection-specific request documents and media types remain with
  their projection owners.

## Query ownership

- Data.Core plans pushdown and residual work. An adapter translates and executes the filter it is
  given; it does not invent a second query planner.
- An adapter reports filter, sort, pagination, projection, total, and count execution independently. Data validates
  the receipt before fallback or public materialization. A false handled flag is a contract failure, not permission
  for a silent retry.
- Data owns the only correctness order: provider candidates, residual predicate, unhandled sort, true total,
  pagination, projection, then application-visible Lifecycle. Candidate rows discarded by those stages do not emit
  load callbacks.
- `QueryDefinition.CountStrategy == null` means no total was requested. Pagination alone must not
  cause an adapter to add count work.
- `DataCaps.Query.ProviderBoundedPaging` means the adapter faithfully executes the
  coordinator-supplied pushable candidate filter and applies the requested candidate page before
  application materialization. Each result must report provider-handled pagination and the complete
  total order. It does not promise cursor resumption, snapshot isolation, or mutation-safe iteration.
- There is no public `Pager`, cursor, resume-token, or provider stream primitive in this assembly.
  Data.Core composes its qualified `AllStream`/`QueryStream` facade from numbered provider pages.

## Entity and batch receipts

- `GetMany` is positional: output cardinality equals input cardinality; identities remain in input order; duplicates
  repeat the same visible result; missing or invisible identities occupy `null` slots.
- Native bulk methods execute once for the prepared set. A mismatched affected count is outcome-unknown and is never
  replayed. Lifecycle preparation completes for the whole set before dispatch; completion callbacks run only after
  an exact successful receipt.
- Exact upsert insert/update distinction is optional and requires both `DataCaps.Write.MutationOutcomes` and
  `IMutationOutcomeRepository`. Ordinary `Save` remains the compact path when the distinction is irrelevant.
- `IBatchSet.ExecutionCapabilities` qualifies the created execution seam. `BatchResult.Atomicity` and
  `CommitOutcome` report what occurred. Complete item outcomes are returned in logical builder order even when the
  provider groups native adds, updates, and deletes.
- Data's transaction coordinator is deferred sequential coordination, published as `TxCaps.DeferredCoordination`.
  It never advertises local/native atomicity; native transaction capabilities belong to the provider's Direct seam.

## Error and compatibility posture

- Unsupported optional behavior should be reported through capability negotiation or a corrective
  `NotSupportedException`, not silently approximated as a stronger guarantee.
- Data owns provider-neutral failure kind, commit outcome, retry disposition, and replay disposition. Adapters
  classify native exception types/codes through `IDataFailureClassifier`; message-text classification is invalid.
- `Committed` and commit `Unknown` outcomes require replay `Never`. Timeout is distinct from caller cancellation,
  and retryability never implies business-operation replay safety.
- Adding a capability token is not sufficient by itself: the adapter must implement and test the
  advertised behavior.
