# Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.DuckDb

DuckDB is Koan's embedded analytical reference adapter: an in-process OLAP engine for aggregation,
bulk load, and lakehouse file queries, with the ordinary Entity experience on top. It complements —
never replaces — the transactional store: SQLite (or any elected provider) remains the system of
record while DuckDB answers the aggregation-shaped questions.

## Install

Reference the connector **and** the native rider (the connector carries only managed bindings; the
engine is a per-RID payload you choose explicitly):

```powershell
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.DuckDb
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.DuckDb.Native
```

For an application-owned store, reference the packages and use the normal bootstrap:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKoan();

var todo = await new Todo { Title = "Ship" }.Save();
var open = await Todo.Query(item => !item.Done, ct);
```

The zero-configuration target is `.koan/data/Koan.duckdb`. DuckDB creates it on first elected use;
merely loading the connector does not touch disk. In-memory sources are served from an ephemeral
scratch store under `.koan/tmp/duckdb/` that dies with the host.

## One writer per file — by composition

DuckDB allows exactly one process to hold a database read-write; on Windows even read-only opens are
excluded while a writer holds the file. The adapter treats that as composition, not a caveat: paths
anchor to the content root (unrelated applications never share a store), a second writer is
classified as an ownership conflict (non-retryable) by the failure classifier and surfaced by the
health probe, and multi-tenant isolation is expressed as Database-mode routing — **one file per
routed tenant**, which is the supported shared-nothing posture.

## Analytics on the store you already have

DuckDB's SQLite extension is built into the engine, so the adapter can `ATTACH` the application's
existing SQLite database and aggregate over it without ingestion:

```csharp
// via raw instruction on any DuckDB-routed source
await Data.Source("analytics").Execute(
    "ATTACH '.koan/data/Koan.sqlite' AS app (TYPE sqlite)");
var rows = await Data.Source("analytics").Query<long>(
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM app.todos");
```

Declared analytics — named, materialized, agent-callable questions — live one layer up in
`Sylin.Koan.Data.Analytics` (DATA-0123).

## Inspect and name useful reads

The provider-neutral source vocabulary works here exactly as on SQLite:

```csharp
var source = Data.Source("Legacy");
var page = await source.Inspect().Containers(100, ct: ct);
var shape = await source.Inspect().Describe(customer, ct);
```

Named reads are enforced by the engine: a read lane opens `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY`, so a lane
cannot write. Lane SQL uses DuckDB's parameter spelling — `$name`, not `@name`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKoan(koan =>
{
    koan.Data.Source("Legacy").Query("customers.active", query => query
        .Lane("Reports")
        .Sql("SELECT customer_no AS Id, display_nm AS Name FROM customer WHERE active = $active")
        .Parameter<bool>("active"));
});
```

## Engine settings

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MemoryLimit` | DuckDB `memory_limit` (e.g. `"2GB"`). The engine defaults to 80% of system RAM — embedded hosts should set this. |
| `Threads` | Engine threads; unset uses all cores. |
| `AutoInstallExtensions` | **`false` by default.** Extension binaries are never downloaded from DuckDB's CDN at runtime unless explicitly enabled. |
| `ExtensionDirectory` | Preloaded extension directory for air-gapped installs (`INSTALL` once, then `LOAD` offline). |

## Honest envelope

- **Single writer per file** across processes; Database-mode routing (one file per tenant) is the
  scale-out posture.
- **Bulk writes ride the Appender-shaped multi-row path**; per-entity `Save()` is correct but not the
  engine's fast path (~1M rows/s bulk vs ~10k rows/s row-at-a-time).
- **Schema policy** is create + validate with repair: most `ALTER` statements work, constraint
  changes do not, and document-expression mapped indexes are **declined** while planner matching is
  unproven (`SupportsRewriteFreeExpressionIndexes = false`).
- **Generated identity** is a sequence-backed column (`DEFAULT nextval(...)` + `RETURNING`).
- Storage format is backward-compatible, not forward-compatible; the native version is pinned by the
  rider package, and `STORAGE_VERSION` pinning is available in options via the connection string.

## Limits

Configuration decides participation; unsupported requests reject before provider work with a named capability and a correction. Provider-specific limits live in the package's TECHNICAL.md.
