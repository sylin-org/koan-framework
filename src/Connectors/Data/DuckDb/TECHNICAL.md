# Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.DuckDb — technical notes

Companion to [README.md](README.md). Decision authority: [DATA-0123](../../../docs/decisions/DATA-0123-embedded-analytics-and-duckdb-connector.md).
Evidence: [ANL-0 spike](../../../docs/assessment/evidence/duckdb-connector-spike.md).

## Package split

`Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.DuckDb` references **`DuckDB.NET.Data`** (managed ADO.NET only,
~235 KB). `Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.DuckDb.Native` references **`DuckDB.NET.Bindings.Full`**
(per-RID libduckdb, ~330 MB uncompressed across five RIDs; floor RIDs linux-x64 / linux-arm64 /
win-x64 all covered). The split keeps hosts in control of their native footprint. Both versions
move in lockstep with the engine (1.5.5 at adoption).

## Instance identity

DuckDB engines are shared per (path + config) within a process: two connections on byte-identical
connection strings join one engine. `DuckDbConnections.Normalize` therefore (a) anchors relative
paths to the content root, (b) folds `DuckDbOptions` engine settings into every string
(`memory_limit`, `threads`, `extension_directory`, `autoinstall_known_extensions=false` by
default), and (c) strips SQLite-only keys (`Mode`, `Cache`, `Pooling` — with `Mode=Memory` selecting
the per-source scratch store). Splitting is quote-aware: a `;` inside a quoted value (a secret)
never fragments the string.

In-memory sources are **connection-private** in DuckDB (each open is an empty database), so they
are materialized as ephemeral scratch files under `.koan/tmp/duckdb/` with a keeper connection and
deleted on host dispose — same observable lifetime as SQLite's `:memory:`, stated plainly.

Non-creating reads do not rely on open modes: a file-backed source that does not exist refuses in
`Create` (`FileNotFoundException`) before any engine call, preserving the SQLite contract that a
look never becomes a write.

## Dialect notes (all probe-verified, ANL-0 R2–R6)

- **Parameters**: SQL spells `$p0`-style names; parameters are added with the bare name. The provider
  does **not** rewrite `@name`. Lane/raw SQL must spell `$name` — `RelationalSourceIntegration` and
  `DirectSession` bind by logical name (prefix stripped), which every ADO.NET provider matches.
- **Upsert**: `ON CONFLICT (keys) DO UPDATE SET col = excluded.col` (requires a PK/unique — the
  schema always declares one). Nested document merges use **`json_merge_patch`** with a patch built
  from the written paths; DuckDB has no `json_set`.
- **Generated identity**: `CREATE SEQUENCE` + `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval(...)` + `RETURNING`.
- **Bulk**: multi-row `VALUES (...), (...)` merged per dispatch (single write shape per dispatch);
  outcome-requiring rows (generated identity, managed-scope guards) execute per-row with `RETURNING`.
- **Ordering**: DuckDB sorts NULL last ascending — the reverse of SQLite and of the framework sorter —
  so every ordered term states `NULLS FIRST`/`NULLS LAST` explicitly.
- **JSON reads**: nested numeric/enum/TimeSpan reads `CAST(col -> '$.path' AS DOUBLE)`; text reads use
  `->>`; Object-shaped reads (array aggregation sources) stay JSON for `json_each`/`json_type`.
  Collection containment compares `json_each(...).value = to_json($p)` — JSON-to-JSON, since a raw
  VARCHAR comparison would attempt to parse the parameter as JSON.
- **Catalog**: `information_schema.columns` + `duckdb_constraints()` replace `PRAGMA table_info`
  (the pragma's rewritten table-function form parses its argument as a qualified name and rejects
  CLR-qualified/partition-suffixed storage names). Index inspection via `duckdb_indexes()`.
- **Types**: document columns are `JSON`; BLOBs hydrate from the provider's `UnmanagedMemoryStream`;
  `TimeSpan` stores as ticks (`BIGINT`) per DATA-0100; enums bind as their underlying number.

## Failure classification

- Second-writer / file-lock open failures (`Cannot open file ... used by another process`) classify
  as ownership conflicts — non-retryable, health-degrading.
- Optimistic-concurrency `Transaction conflict` errors classify as retryable.
- Extension-not-installed failures are corrective: the message names `INSTALL` + the connector's
  preload options.

## Capability envelope (declared)

Everything `SqliteFeatures` declares, plus `Write.MutationOutcomes` (`RETURNING`). Deliberately
undeclared: `query.fastCount`/`query.optimizedCount` (conservative v1), vector/FTS (upstream VSS
remains experimental), and `SupportsRewriteFreeExpressionIndexes = false` — document-expression
mapped indexes are declined until planner matching is demonstrated.

## Conformance

`tests/Suites/Data/Connector.DuckDb/` — 49 specs mirroring the SQLite suite: AODB conformance (all
three isolation modes; Database mode = one file per routed tenant), filter/sort convergence with the
in-memory oracle, DATA-0100 comparable-encoding convergence, provider-bounded paging, source
integration and read lanes, cold restart, connection lifecycle (including per-source memory
isolation), boot provenance, health contributor, and the connection-string redaction guard.
