# Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.MySql

Use MySQL as the record store behind Koan's existing Entity API.

## Use the connector

Reference `Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.MySql`; keep the application's single `AddKoan()` call.

```bash
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.MySql
```

```csharp
public sealed class Todo : Entity<Todo>
{
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public bool Done { get; set; }
}

var todo = await new Todo { Title = "Ship it" }.Save(ct);
var open = await Todo.Query(item => !item.Done, ct);
```

No MySQL repository or registration API is required.

## Configure MySQL

Use a normal MySqlConnector connection string when discovery is not appropriate:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MySql": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=Koan;User ID=root;Password=mysql"
  }
}
```

`Koan:Data:MySql:ConnectionString` is the provider-scoped alternative. A `mysql://` URI is accepted and normalized; recognized MySqlConnector options may be supplied as query parameters. Unknown URI options fail before opening a connection.

For a named source, configure the standard source connection and select it with `EntityContext.Source(...)`. The database in that source's final connection string is its storage boundary unless a source-scoped MySQL `Database` setting explicitly overrides it.

## Guarantees and limits

- The supported server line is MySQL 8.4.
- The configured database must already exist. Managed lifecycle can create Entity tables; it does not create databases.
- Production table creation additionally requires `AllowProductionDdl=true`; Koan never infers production DDL consent.
- Managed tables use InnoDB. An existing non-InnoDB table is rejected because atomic-batch semantics cannot be claimed for it.
- `SchemaMatching=Relaxed` still requires every mapped storage column, the exact primary key, and compatible identity/JSON shapes. `Strict` additionally verifies every mapped column's native type, nullability, and generated-column shape.
- Filters execute in MySQL, and paging adds a stable identity tiebreak.
- Managed row-scope values are stored in the Entity JSON document and guard conflicting writes.
- Unreachable endpoints, unresolved `auto`, unconfigured named sources, denied DDL/write access, and incompatible schemas fail at the connector boundary.

This connector targets MySQL. MariaDB compatibility is not asserted by this package.
