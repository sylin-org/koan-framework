# Firebird adapter — provider contract and operations

Technical reference for maintainers. Status: **not assessed**; conformance proven against
`firebirdsql/firebird:5.0.4` with `FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient` 10.3.4, .NET 10, Windows host,
2026-08-29. The adapter rides `Koan.Data.Relational` (mapping compilation, filter translation,
schema orchestration, readiness coordination, `AdoCommands`/`SqlParameters`) and owns only Firebird
translation and execution.

## Verified provider facts (probe log)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Wire auth | Srp plugin required on the client; server default is Srp256-only → set `AuthServer="Srp256, Srp"` |
| Wire encryption | FirebirdClient cannot do `Required` → `WireCrypt=Enabled` |
| Admin password env | `FIREBIRD_ROOT_PASSWORD` (image ignores `ISC_PASSWORD`) |
| Config env | `FIREBIRD_CONF_<Key>` with the conf file's exact casing |
| Identifiers | double-quoted, case-exact, 63-byte cap; dots legal inside quotes |
| Upsert | `UPDATE OR INSERT INTO … VALUES … MATCHING (id)` + optional `RETURNING col` (singleton) |
| Paging | `OFFSET n ROWS FETCH NEXT m ROWS ONLY` (requires the ORDER BY every query already carries) |
| NULLS ordering | `NULLS FIRST/LAST` supported (4.0+); placement always stated explicitly |
| JSON functions | none — drives the shadow-column design below |
| Native binds | Guid↔`CHAR(16) OCTETS`, `bool`, `DateTime`, `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`, `TimeSpan`; **no** `DateTimeOffset` (encoded text) |
| Missing database | connect fails `FbException` code `335544344` (isc_io_error), SQLSTATE 08001 → `CreateDatabase` under managed consent |
| Duplicate key | code `335544665` (isc_no_dup), SQLSTATE 23000 → cross-scope write classification |
| Read-only lane | `FbTransactionBehavior.Concurrency \| Read` — engine-enforced |
| TRUNCATE | absent — `RemoveStrategy.Fast` lowers to `DELETE FROM` |
| Oversize strings | "string right truncation" corrective error, never clipped |
| DDL concurrency | transactional DDL; concurrent `CREATE TABLE`s deadlock → executor serializes behind one gate |

## Runtime map

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Route resolution, read lanes, naming capability | `FirebirdAdapterFactory` (+ `AdapterConnectionResolver`) |
| Dialect (quote, parameters, LIKE escape, path reads) | `FirebirdDialect` |
| Plan per entity (SELECT, hydration, shadow columns, encoded scalars) | `FirebirdEntityPlan` : `RelationalEntityPlan` |
| Capability declaration | `FirebirdFeatures` (scalar-only `FilterSupport`) |
| Store features for the schema owner | `FirebirdStoreFeatures` (all optional features false) |
| Schema DDL, catalog describe, database creation | `FirebirdDdlExecutor` (RDB$ system tables; DdlGate) |
| Repository surface | `FirebirdRepository` (`AdoCommands`/`SqlParameters`) |
| Inspection (list/resolve/describe/sample) | `FirebirdInspector` |
| Source Integration | `RelationalSourceIntegration` over `FirebirdConnectionFactory` |
| Health, discovery, options | `FirebirdHealthContributor`, `FirebirdDiscoveryAdapter`, `FirebirdOptions(Configurator)` |

## Shadow columns (the design decision)

The shared mapping stores each entity as `(Id, Json)`. With no JSON functions, nothing inside the
document is reachable by SQL, so `FirebirdEntityPlan.ShadowColumns` enumerates every top-level
scalar document path plus the registered managed discriminators; `FirebirdDdlExecutor` creates them;
`Insert`/`UpdateSet` write them from `plan.ShadowValues(entity)` (the same bindings, encoded by the
same `EncodeScalar` the comparands use); `FirebirdDialect.Read` answers a single-segment nested path
with the quoted column. Consequences:

- scalar filters, sorts, declared indexes and managed-isolation predicates are store-enforced;
- deeper paths refuse (`NestedPaths=false` declared; the coordinator routes them to the floor);
- collection-shaped bindings (e.g. `List<string>`) stay document-only; their operators are absent
  from `FilterSupport.CollectionOperators`, and running them records a `koan.data.query.fallback`
  fact — the residual is declared, visible, and convergent;
- tables created before a managed field was registered lack its column; the first scoped write then
  fails naming the missing column (corrective). This adapter is new, so no upgrade population exists.

## Evidence

- `Koan.Data.Connector.Firebird.Tests` — 14 specs, all green (two consecutive runs): AODB record-plane
  conformance (isolation declarations + row/container/database realization, streaming fail-closed,
  polymorphic roots), full filter-convergence corpus, scalar pushdown guard, residual-fact honesty,
  scalar ordering convergence, paged windows, no-fallback scalar pages, capability truth, boot
  provenance.
- Reasoned non-hosted cells: `FilterConvergence.AssertPushesDownAsync` and
  `SortPushdownConvergence.AssertConvergesAsync/AssertStreamsAsync/AssertNothingFallsBackAsync`
  (collection lowering and streaming are declared limits — the hosted specs prove the declaration and
  the fail-closed path instead).
- Packaging: `dotnet pack` with the release-train version; package id `Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.Firebird`.
