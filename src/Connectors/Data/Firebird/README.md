# Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.Firebird

Firebird 5 relational storage for Koan. Reference the package, call `AddKoan()`, and `Entity<T>`
persistence runs against a Firebird server — same `Save`/`Get`/`Query`/`Page` vocabulary as every
Koan store.

> **Supported provider** (`firebird-data-provider`): the record-plane conformance suite passes against a
> real Firebird 5 server — conformance, filter convergence, sort and paging oracles, capability truth —
> and the connector is machine-checked under NativeAOT by `scripts/aot-verify.ps1`. The Limits below are
> part of the claim.

## Install

```powershell
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.Firebird
```

```json
{ "Koan": { "Data": { "Sources": { "Default": {
  "Adapter": "firebird",
  "ConnectionString": "DataSource=localhost;Port=3050;Database=/var/lib/firebird/data/koan.fdb;User=SYSDBA;Password=masterkey;Charset=UTF8" } } } } }
```

A `firebird://user:password@host:port/database` URI is accepted and normalized to the same form.
The database is a file on the server; under managed lifecycle policy the adapter creates it when
absent (`FbConnection.CreateDatabase`) before the first table DDL.

## What it adds

| Capability | State |
|---|---|
| `Query.Linq` / `Query.String` / `Query.Filter` (scalar operators) | declared and store-executed |
| Isolation: row / container / database scoped | declared, proven by the record-plane suite |
| Atomic batch, bulk upsert/delete, fast remove, conditional replace | declared |
| Collection filter operators (`$in`/`$all`/`$size` on `List<T>`) | **not declared** — Firebird has no JSON functions; the framework floor answers them, and the query records a runtime fallback fact |
| Nested-path filters | **not declared** (`NestedPaths=false`) — top-level scalars only |
| Provider-bounded paging (streams) | **not declared** — streaming rejects with `QueryStreamRejectedException`; use `Page` |

## How it works without JSON functions

The shared mapping stores an entity as one JSON document column. Other relational adapters lower
paths inside it with store JSON functions; Firebird 5 has none. This adapter mirrors every top-level
scalar into a plain **shadow column** — created by the schema executor, written beside the document
from the same encoded value, read by filters and sorts as a flat column — so scalar predicates and
orders are still answered by the store, and framework-managed isolation discriminators are still
enforced at the row level. Deeper paths refuse with a corrective message.

## Firebird server notes (learned the hard way)

- The official `firebirdsql/firebird` image accepts `FIREBIRD_CONF_*` variables as `firebird.conf`
  keys — spelled exactly as in the file (`FIREBIRD_CONF_WireCrypt`, not `FIREBIRD_CONF_WIRECRYPT`).
- The FirebirdClient cannot negotiate `WireCrypt=Required` or the Srp256-only default auth set: start
  the server with `FIREBIRD_CONF_WireCrypt=Enabled` and `FIREBIRD_CONF_AuthServer="Srp256, Srp"`, or
  every connection fails with a misleading "user name and password are not defined".
- The SYSDBA password is set by `FIREBIRD_ROOT_PASSWORD`; `ISC_PASSWORD` is ignored by this image.

The container fixture in the test project wires all of this; it is the working reference.

## Limits

- Identifier cap: 63 bytes (Firebird); default naming style is `HashedNamespace`, which keeps table
  names well under it.
- Strings: non-identity text columns are `VARCHAR(8191)`; oversize values fail with a corrective
  truncation error rather than being clipped.
- No `TRUNCATE` on this engine — `RemoveStrategy.Fast` is a plain `DELETE FROM`.
- Schema validation reports column presence and primary-key membership; it does not compare column
  definitions (a store type a CLR type cannot see is not faked), matching the SQLite/DuckDB posture.
