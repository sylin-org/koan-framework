# Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.Couchbase

Couchbase persistence for Koan entities, compact external mappings, neutral source inspection, and
registered SQL++ reads. Add the package, keep the normal `AddKoan()` bootstrap, and use Entity verbs.

- Target framework: net10.0
- License: Apache-2.0

## Install

```powershell
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.Couchbase
```

## Managed entities

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKoan();

public sealed class Product : Entity<Product>
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "";
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

var product = await new Product { Name = "Garden sensor", Price = 24.50m }.Save();
var affordable = await Product.Query(item => item.Price < 50m);
```

Known-key reads and writes use Couchbase KV. Set queries, counts, sorting, and explicit pages use
parameterized SQL++. Managed sources create missing scopes, collections, and query indexes on demand.

## Existing collections

`Namespace` maps to a Couchbase scope and `Container` maps to a collection:

```csharp
koan.Data.Source("Legacy").Map<Customer>(map => map
    .Container(StorageAddress.From("erp", "customers"))
    .Key(customer => customer.Id).Name("CUSTOMER_NO")
    .Property(customer => customer.Name).Name("DISPLAY_NM")
    .Property(customer => customer.Profile).Object("PROFILE"));
```

Mapped updates use CAS and change only declared paths, preserving fields owned by the external
system. Nested `.Path(...)` and composite `.Parts(...)` keys are supported. Couchbase document keys
are application-assigned; `.Generated()` is rejected with a corrective error.

Use `StorageLifecycle.External` when Koan must never create scopes, collections, or indexes. Use
`DataSourceAccess.ReadOnly` when every mutation must fail before provider I/O. The two policies are
independent and default to Managed/ReadWrite.

## Inspect and run named reads

```csharp
koan.Data.Source("Legacy").Query("customers.active", query => query
    .Lane("Reports")
    .Sql("SELECT META(c).id AS Id, c.name AS Name FROM `erp`.`crm`.`customers` AS c WHERE c.active = $active")
    .Parameter<bool>("active"));

var source = Koan.Data.Core.Data.Source("Legacy");
var active = await source.Query("customers.active", new { active = true });
var containers = await source.Inspect().Containers(take: 25);
```

Registered SQL++ requires a configured read lane and is executed with Couchbase's read-only query
option. Inspection returns Koan Source/Namespace/Container descriptors and neutral records, not SDK
bucket-manager types.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": { "Couchbase": "couchbase://localhost" },
  "Koan": {
    "Data": {
      "Couchbase": {
        "Bucket": "Products",
        "Username": "${secret}",
        "Password": "${secret}",
        "Durability": "Majority"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`Durability` accepts `None`, `Majority`, `MajorityAndPersistToActive`, or `PersistToMajority` and is
applied to every KV mutation. Invalid values fail during route construction. `Scope`, `Collection`,
`QueryTimeout`, `BootstrapTimeout`, and `BootstrapPollInterval` are optional provider settings.

## Guarantee boundary

- LINQ/filter translation is native, parameterized, and receipt-backed.
- Conditional replace uses opaque Couchbase CAS.
- Bulk operations are bounded; batches are non-atomic unless and until Koan has a replay-safe
  transaction callback contract. `RequireAtomic` and idempotency-key claims reject.
- Entity streaming uses explicit provider-bounded pages. It is not snapshot-consistent, resumable,
  or mutation-safe.
- One host-owned cluster is shared per connection and credential identity; bucket handles are shared
  within it. Repositories never own SDK clients.
- External queries require externally managed indexes. Koan does not create them as a side effect.
