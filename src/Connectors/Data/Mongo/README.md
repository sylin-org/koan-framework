# Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.Mongo

Use MongoDB through Koan's ordinary Entity and Source surfaces. The connector owns clients, BSON, collection naming,
indexes, discovery, mapping, inspection, and native execution.

```powershell
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Data.Connector.Mongo
```

## Save and query documents

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKoan();

public sealed class Book : Entity<Book>
{
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public bool Published { get; set; }
}

var book = await new Book { Title = "Meaningful steps", Published = true }.Save();
var published = await Book.Query(item => item.Published);
```

No MongoDB repository, client, serializer registration, or collection bootstrap appears in application code.

## Fit a legacy collection without changing the model

```csharp
koan.Data.Source("Legacy").Map<Customer>(map => map
    .Container("CUSTOMER")
    .Key(customer => customer.Id).Name("CUSTOMER_NO")
    .Property(customer => customer.Name.Full).Name("DISPLAY_NM")
    .Property(customer => customer.Profile).Object("PROFILE")
    .Property(customer => customer.Name.First).Path("NAME_DATA", "first"));
```

The same Entity verbs now use those physical names. Mapped writes update only declared physical paths, so fields owned
by the legacy system remain untouched. Composite keys use `.Key(...).Parts(...)`. Mark the source `External` to prevent
collection creation, and `ReadOnly` to reject every mutation before provider I/O.

```json
{
  "Koan": {
    "Data": {
      "Sources": {
        "Legacy": {
          "Adapter": "mongo",
          "ConnectionString": "mongodb://legacy-host:27017",
          "Database": "erp",
          "StorageLifecycle": "External",
          "Access": "ReadOnly"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## See what a source contains

```csharp
var source = Koan.Data.Core.Data.Source("Legacy");
var page = await source.Inspect().Containers(take: 25);
var customer = await source.Inspect().Resolve(StorageAddress.From("CUSTOMER"));
RecordSet sample = await source.Inspect().Sample(customer, take: 20);
```

The vocabulary stays provider-neutral: sources contain addressable containers with traits and operations. MongoDB
returns collections and views through that surface. Samples preserve top-level BSON field order and duplicate names,
missing values, binary and temporal values, nested objects, arrays, nulls, and explicit result bounds.

## Give a native pipeline a business name

```csharp
koan.Data.Source("Catalog").Query("products.low-stock", query => query
    .Pipeline("products",
        """{ "$match": { "stock": { "$lte": "{{threshold}}" } } }""",
        """{ "$sort": { "stock": 1 } }""")
    .Parameter<int>("threshold"));

RecordSet result = await Koan.Data.Core.Data
    .Source("Catalog")
    .Query("products.low-stock", new { threshold = 5 });
```

Parameters replace exact `{{name}}` BSON string values after parsing; they are never interpolated into JSON. `$out`
and `$merge` are rejected when the operation is declared, so registered pipelines are validated reads.

## Configuration

`auto` is the default. Options access remains pure; the first operation on an active MongoDB route asks Koan's
discovery coordinator for MongoDB and falls back to `mongodb://localhost:27017` when automatic discovery has no result.
Concurrent first callers share that one resolution. A concrete connection string is authoritative.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": { "Mongo": "mongodb://localhost:27017" },
  "Koan": { "Data": { "Mongo": { "Database": "Books" } } }
}
```

Explicit `zen-garden://...` intent must resolve; it never silently falls back. Credentials belong in the platform's
secret store.

## Honest capability boundary

MongoDB provides native filters, exact counts, explicit paging, bulk upsert/delete, conditional replace, TTL indexes,
and row/container/database isolation. The connector does not claim fast remove or atomic batch execution. A batch is
an ordered bulk write; `RequireAtomic=true` rejects before mutation because transaction support depends on topology and
has not been selected as a connector guarantee.

`All()` means all visible records. Use explicit pages or Koan's bounded stream surface for growing sets. Numbered-page
streaming is not snapshot-consistent or resumable and concurrent writes can cause skips or duplicates.

## What it adds

MongoDB data provider for Koan: options binding and repository integration for document databases.
