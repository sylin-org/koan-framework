## Contract

- Provider `mongo` (alias `mongodb`, priority 20) is registered by `AddKoan()`.
- `MongoAdapterFactory` is the sole route and repository authority. It also supplies source inspection and registered
  pipeline execution without manufacturing an Entity repository.
- `MongoClientManager` owns one bounded, reusable `MongoClient` per resolved connection/database route.
- One `MongoRepository<TEntity,TKey>` implements managed and explicit-mapping behavior through one compiled
  `MongoEntityPlan`; there is no compatibility repository or alternate execution stack.

## Storage representation

Managed entities are serialized by an adapter-owned Json.NET configuration, converted recursively to native BSON, and
stored with `_id` as the physical identity. Camel-case member names and Koan's polymorphic discriminator are stable
adapter decisions. `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` are normalized to UTC BSON dates; `TimeSpan`, `DateOnly`, and
`TimeOnly` use comparable deterministic encodings.

An explicit `MappingPlan` replaces naming conventions with compiled physical bindings. Reads hydrate through those
bindings. Writes use `$set` for each declared path and `$setOnInsert` for a mapped `_id`, preserving unbound fields and
unbound siblings inside a structured document. Managed documents use the cheaper whole-document replace path.

Mapped collections cannot also accept an ambient container partition. Explicit maps reject framework-managed row
fields because that combination cannot preserve both external ownership and hidden scope values without another
declared physical binding.

## Query and mutation execution

`MongoQueryCompiler` lowers the declared filter floor, nested canonical paths, exact sort prefixes, explicit pages,
and counts to driver definitions over physical BSON names. Unsupported CLR residuals do not enter the repository.
Identity batches are bounded; bulk writes are ordered and require acknowledged driver receipts.

Guarded upserts include Koan's managed-field write scope. A duplicate `_id` produced by an attempted cross-scope upsert
is surfaced as a corrective cross-scope failure. Conditional writes combine identity, caller predicate, and managed
scope in one native operation.

Mongo batches use one ordered `BulkWrite`. They intentionally advertise no atomic execution capability; atomic or
idempotency requirements reject before mutation. The connector does not infer topology support or replay an ambiguous
commit.

## Collection and index realization

`MongoSchema` is a retryable, host-bounded gate per physical collection. `Managed` creates a missing collection and
realizes declared indexes. `External` verifies existence and performs no DDL. Managed conventions and explicit mapping
plans both lower their index paths through the same physical decisions used by reads and writes. TTL declarations use
MongoDB's native zero-second expiry index.

## Inspection and registered operations

Inspection exposes database-relative `StorageAddress` values, collection/view traits, effective read/write operations,
bounded pagination, and bounded samples. MongoDB collections have no promised fixed shape, so `Describe` reports no
synthetic schema. A sample builds a neutral union of observed top-level fields; each record preserves missing separately
from null and converts nested BSON to `DataObject`/`DataArray`.

`MongoPipelineBinding` stores validated JSON stages and the target collection. It rejects `$out` and `$merge` during
composition and therefore carries `ValidatedRead` proof. Execution parses immutable stages, structurally substitutes
declared `{{parameter}}` values as BSON, appends a provider bound, and returns neutral records or an exact one-record,
one-field scalar receipt.

## Discovery, readiness, and resources

Default `auto` connection resolution uses `IServiceDiscoveryCoordinator`; explicit `zen-garden://` intent is required
and fail-closed. Concrete native endpoints bypass discovery. Health probes use the same route and client owner as data
operations. Referencing the package alone does not create a MongoDB client.

Route clients and per-repository collection gates are bounded. Driver clients are reused for the host lifetime and
disposed with the host. Collection enumeration, identity batches, pipeline results, and inspection samples all have
explicit bounds.

## Capability truth

The adapter declares native LINQ/filter execution, provider-bounded paging, bulk upsert/delete, conditional replace,
TTL indexes, and row/container/database isolation. It does not declare `AtomicBatch` or `FastRemove`. Query receipts
report only work completed by MongoDB.

## Verification

The connector project and test project build with zero warnings. The real MongoDB 8.3 suite passes 34/34, covering
managed CRUD, filtering convergence, comparable values, identity types, partitions, routing, discovery, health,
instructions, batching, capability truth, managed-field isolation, explicit legacy mapping, read-only/external policy,
inspection, and registered pipelines.
