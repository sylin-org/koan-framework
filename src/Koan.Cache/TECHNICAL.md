# Koan Cache technical notes

## Ownership

Cache owns policy materialization, Entity cache identity, L1/L2 topology, serialization,
singleflight, tag operations, and peer-invalidation meaning. Data invokes an ordered repository
decorator but does not know Cache policy or transport. Communication owns carriage, election, wire,
lifecycle, ingress, health, and facts; it never decides what an invalidation means.

The Entity surface has two deliberate planes:

- `entity.Cache.Evict()` and its finite/stream forms address concrete entries;
- `EntityType.Cache.Explain/Flush/Count/Any` inspect policy or operate on policy-derived tags.

MCP operational flush remains a separately governed and audited type/global control plane. Entry
eviction is not automatically projected as an agent mutation.

## Canonical Entity cache plan

`EntityCachePlan` is the single host-level decision seam consumed by `CacheRepositoryDecorator` and
`EntityCacheEvictionCoordinator`. It:

1. selects the first active Entity-scoped policy;
2. excludes entities whose restored storage representation or non-equality read scope cannot be
   safely represented by an id-keyed cache;
3. parses the selected key template;
4. supplies canonical Entity type identity and partition/source template values; and
5. produces the business/base key only; `CacheIdentityPlan` applies Core hard-segmentation dimensions
   once at the `CacheClient` boundary for keys, tags, singleflight, eviction, and coherence.

Repository reads, writes, deletes, batch mutations, and explicit eviction therefore cannot select a
different policy or independently reconstruct a key. A custom Entity key template must remain
derivable for every operation that uses it; templates needed by id-based reads normally use
`{TypeName}`, `{Partition}`, `{Source}`, `{Id}`, and `{Key}`.

Types with storage field transforms, non-equality read predicates, or Data-local managed fields that
have not joined Core hard segmentation are not decorated. Caching their provider representation or
omitting a Data-only scope from Cache identity would be unsafe. Explicit entry eviction rejects such a
type before enumerating because no entry can validly exist.

## Eviction execution

The scalar, finite, and asynchronous Entity facets normalize to one lazy source through Data.Core's
`EntityCardinality`. `EntityCacheEvictionCoordinator` resolves the plan and captures
`EntityContext.ContextState` plus every registered `KoanContextCarrierRegistry` axis before the first
await. It restores both around deferred enumeration and each writer call.

Execution is sequential and constant-memory. Source order and multiplicity are preserved; there is no
read-ahead while one removal is pending. Default identifiers are skipped. Every non-default Entity is
formatted through the resolved plan and sent to `ICacheWriter.Remove`, which removes from the selected
topology and requests peer invalidation even when the key was locally absent.

`EntityCacheEviction` retains counters only. On source/removal failure or cancellation, typed errors
retain the confirmed prefix. Store-tier removal and peer carriage are separate awaits, not one atomic
commit; the current item may be partly removed when a failure is reported.

## Topology and coherence

The built-in Memory store is the minimum-priority local floor. `CacheTopologyResolver` independently
elects local and remote stores from explicit pins, provider priority, then stable identity.
Core's immutable provider catalog owns exact name lookup, duplicate rejection, memoized priority, and
the final stable tie; Cache alone owns Local/Remote placement and whether a missing tier is valid. Each
selected tier carries one safe receipt that startup facts and the resolved lock project directly.
`LayeredCache` reads L1 then L2, backfills L1, writes selected tiers, and evicts both selected tiers.

Successful removals publish one Cache-owned key invalidation through Communication's every-node
framework route. Peers filter their own origin and evict L1 only; they never mutate shared L2 or
rebroadcast. The local Communication floor is automatic. Redis contributes a layered broadcast
candidate only while Redis owns the remote tier; a direct RabbitMQ reference is ordinary provider
intent. L1 TTL bounds staleness when a best-effort invalidation is lost.

## Inspection and unsupported scenarios

The policy lifecycle owner materializes the registry before composition facts are collected, even though
the normal hosted-service start occurs later. Composition facts and startup logs expose topology, policy
count, each selected Entity entry plan or safety exclusion, coherence mode, effective broadcast
provider/assurance, active state, node identity, and L1-only receipt behavior. Health exposes the live
topology/coherence posture. Runtime-agent facts reuse those decisions; no surface infers topology from
package names.

Unsupported claims include collection atomicity, distributed transaction coupling, durable
invalidation replay/catch-up, automatic removal retry, remote settlement, and global flush as a wire
primitive. Tag flush enumerates matching entries and emits normal per-key invalidations.
