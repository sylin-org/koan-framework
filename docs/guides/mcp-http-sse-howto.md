# MCP over HTTP

## Contract

- **Use this surface when** an MCP client reaches the application over a network. Use STDIO when a
  local client owns the server process and does not need an HTTP security boundary.
- **Inputs**: a Koan Web application, a reference to `Koan.Mcp`, at least one `[McpEntity]` or
  `[McpTool]` surface, and `Koan:Mcp:EnableStreamableHttpTransport=true`.
- **Outputs**: caller-specific tools and resources over one Streamable HTTP endpoint (`/mcp` by
  default).
- **Failure modes**: invalid protocol negotiation, missing/expired sessions, unsupported content
  negotiation, unavailable tools, or denied caller authority.
- **Success criteria**: the client initializes, receives a session id, discovers only usable tools,
  invokes them through `POST /mcp`, and can inspect the same runtime facts as an operator.

## Shortest supported path

MCP belongs to the supported 0.20 extension surface. The repository verifies the same path from source and the
exact staged candidate; public-feed publication and observation remain release-phase work.

Reference Koan MCP and Web in the application closure, then expose business data or workflows:

```csharp
using Koan.Data.Core.Model;
using Koan.Mcp;

[McpEntity(
    Name = "product",
    Description = "A product in the public catalog",
    AllowMutations = false)]
public sealed class Product : Entity<Product>
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "";
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public bool IsDiscontinued { get; set; }
}
```

Keep the normal Koan bootstrap:

```csharp
using Koan.Core;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddKoan();
var app = builder.Build();
await app.RunAsync();
```

Enable the network transport:

```json
{
  "Koan": {
    "Mcp": {
      "EnableStreamableHttpTransport": true,
      "Exposure": "Tools"
    }
  }
}
```

The package reference is the registration. Do not add `AddKoanMcp()`, map MCP endpoints manually,
or assign `AppHost.Current` in application code.

## Streamable HTTP sequence

The same base route handles the complete session:

| Request | Required intent | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /mcp` with `initialize` | Start protocol negotiation without a session header | `200`; response includes `Mcp-Session-Id` |
| `POST /mcp` with a request | Send `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `resources/*`, or `ping` | JSON-RPC response as per-request SSE, or JSON when configured |
| `POST /mcp` with a notification | Send a message with no JSON-RPC id | `202` with no body |
| `GET /mcp` | Open the optional standalone server-push stream | Resumable SSE; one open GET stream per session |
| `DELETE /mcp` | End the current session | `200`; later use of the id returns `404` |

For `POST`, send `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`. The first request carries the
protocol version in `initialize.params`. Later requests echo both `Mcp-Session-Id` and
`MCP-Protocol-Version`.

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"1.0"}}}'
```

Read `Mcp-Session-Id` from the response headers, then list tools:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: <session-id>" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

A normal MCP client performs this negotiation. Application code should not implement JSON-RPC or
session handling.

## Tool authoring and discovery

`[McpEntity]` projects applicable Entity operations through the same endpoint service and access
rules as REST. `AllowMutations=false` removes generated mutation tools; it is not authorization.

Use a custom tool for a business workflow rather than recreating Entity CRUD:

```csharp
public sealed class ProductTools : Toolset
{
    [McpTool(
        Name = "product_discontinue",
        Description = "Discontinues a product that is no longer sold.",
        IsMutation = true)]
    public async Task<string> Discontinue(string id, CancellationToken ct = default)
    {
        var product = await Product.Get(id, ct);
        if (product is null) return "Product not found.";

        product.IsDiscontinued = true;
        await product.Save(ct);
        return "Product discontinued.";
    }
}
```

Give workflow mutations `IsMutation=true`. Their input schema advertises the reserved
`dry_run: boolean` control. Koan cannot inspect arbitrary imperative effects, so `dry_run=true` does
not execute a custom verb; it returns an honest partial rehearsal with
`meta.diagnostics.rehearsable=false`. Generated Entity mutations can run the framework-owned
validation path and return a prospective state delta without committing.

Ordinary Entity property names are valid schema descriptions. Add `[McpDescription]`,
`[Description]`, or `[Display(Description=...)]` when a property needs richer agent guidance; missing
optional prose is not a startup warning.

Use `[McpIgnore]` for fields that must not cross the agent surface. Directional input/output
exclusion is supported. This is a static type-level projection, not a per-caller data policy; use
Entity access declarations and constraints for caller-specific authority.

## Inspect the running surface

- `tools/list` is the authoritative caller-visible tool catalog.
- `koan://self` introduces the usable Entity and custom-workflow surface.
- `koan://entities` describes Entity tools only; it may be empty in a custom-tool-only application.
- `koan://facts` returns the same versioned, redacted runtime fact envelope as
  `/.well-known/Koan/facts`.

Advertisement and invocation use the same caller-aware projection. A disabled or unauthorized tool
is absent from discovery and cannot be reached by calling its name directly.

## Security posture

HTTP authentication defaults on in Production and containers. Development may be open for local
inspection. For a production edge:

1. serve MCP over HTTPS;
2. configure `ResourceUri` to the externally stable `/mcp` audience when behind a proxy;
3. reference `Koan.Web.Auth.Server` for Koan's OAuth 2.1 authorization-server/resource-server path,
   or register the application’s external bearer scheme;
4. declare Entity access and custom-tool scopes for business authority;
5. configure `AllowedOrigins` when browser clients are permitted;
6. keep operational toolsets disabled unless explicitly needed and grant-gated.

See [OAuth server](oauth-server-howto.md) for token acquisition and
[authorization](authorization-howto.md) for the Entity/tool authority model.

## Configuration reference

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `EnableStdioTransport` | `true` | Host the local process-owned transport |
| `EnableStreamableHttpTransport` | `false` | Host the primary Streamable HTTP edge |
| `EnableLegacySseTransport` | `false` | Host the deprecated `/sse` + `/rpc` compatibility edge |
| `HttpRoute` | `/mcp` | Shared base route for MCP over HTTP |
| `RequireAuthentication` | environment-derived | Require a remote authenticated principal |
| `ResourceUri` | unset | Fixed OAuth resource/audience identifier |
| `MaxConcurrentSessions` | `100` | Bound active HTTP sessions |
| `SessionIdleTimeout` | `30 minutes` | Reclaim idle sessions after this interval |
| `EnableCors` | `false` | Enable the MCP CORS policy |
| `AllowedOrigins` | empty | Origins admitted when CORS is enabled |
| `Transport.StreamableJsonResponse` | `false` | Return JSON instead of per-request SSE for request POSTs |
| `Transport.StreamReplayBufferSize` | `256` | Recent events retained per stream for resume |
| `Transport.MaxRetainedStreamsPerSession` | `64` | Bound completed request streams retained per session |

## Failure interpretation

| Observation | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `400`, error `-32000` | Non-initialize request has no session | Initialize first and echo the session id |
| `400` after negotiation | Unsupported protocol contract | Send the negotiated `MCP-Protocol-Version` |
| `401` | Remote authentication failed | Follow the protected-resource challenge or fix bearer configuration |
| `403` or a structured short-circuit | Caller lacks business authority | Correct grants; do not retry unchanged |
| `404`, error `-32001` | Session expired or was terminated | Re-initialize and replace the session id |
| `406` | POST does not accept the supported response media types | Send both JSON and event-stream in `Accept` |
| `409` on `GET /mcp` | A standalone GET stream is already open | Reuse or close the existing stream |
| Tool absent from `tools/list` | Not composed, disabled, or not permitted for this caller | Inspect `koan://self`, `koan://facts`, and access configuration |

## Verified evidence and limits

Run the current real-host Streamable HTTP evidence from a source checkout:

```powershell
dotnet test tests/Suites/Mcp/Koan.Mcp.Streamable.IntegrationTests/Koan.Mcp.Streamable.IntegrationTests.csproj -c Release
```

The suite covers negotiation, content handling, session mint/resolve/terminate, authorization,
Explorer coexistence, server push, and resumption. The broader conformance suite covers tool schema,
access projection, resources, dry-run behavior, and Entity execution.

Current evidence does not certify multi-node session sharing, every reverse proxy, every MCP client,
or exactly-once custom-tool effects. Sessions are process-owned; a distributed deployment must route
a session consistently or re-initialize after it moves.

See [AI-0037](../decisions/AI-0037-mcp-streamable-http-transport.md) for the transport decision and
the [MCP module contract](../../src/Koan.Mcp/README.md) for the shortest application-facing summary.
