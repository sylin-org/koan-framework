# Composition Lockfile (`koan.lock.json`)

**What is this app, exactly?** — answered without booting it. Any supported package graph containing
`Sylin.Koan.Core` makes the application build emit a checked-in `koan.lock.json` describing its static
composition. The target flows through Koan's application bundles, so no direct Core reference is
required. PR review then shows composition drift in a plain `git diff`; at boot the host writes a
richer **resolved twin** and the boot report prints a one-line verdict.

## The UX

```bash
dotnet build                  # koan.lock.json is refreshed automatically
git diff koan.lock.json       # PR review now SHOWS composition drift, e.g.:
                              #   +    { "id": "Koan.Data.Connector.Postgres", "version": "0.17" }
```

At boot the report prints:

```text
Composition  7 modules · lockfile ok
```

…or, when the running composition diverged from the checked-in file:

```text
Composition  8 modules · lockfile DRIFT(+Koan.Cache)
```

## Two emitters, one schema

| File | Written by | When | Checked in? | Sections |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `koan.lock.json` | the transitive `Sylin.Koan.Core` build target | every supported application build | **yes** | `schema`, `app`, `modules` |
| `obj/koan.lock.resolved.json` | the host at boot | each run (non-production) | no (gitignored) | the above **plus** `elections`, `configKeys`, `entities`, (best-effort) `capabilities` |

The build-time file carries only what is honestly knowable **without running the app**: identity and
the Koan packages it is composed of. Adapter **elections** and negotiated **capabilities** are
runtime concerns (they depend on configuration and on what each provider negotiates — ARCH-0084), so
they live only in the resolved twin.

### Build-time `koan.lock.json`

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 1,
  "app": { "name": "S5.Recs", "koan": "0.17", "tfm": "net10.0" },
  "modules": [
    { "id": "Koan.Core", "version": "0.17" },
    { "id": "Koan.Data.Connector.Postgres", "version": "0.17" }
  ]
}
```

Versions are **major.minor** — the pre-1.0 breaking tier ([ARCH-0085](../decisions/ARCH-0085-versioning-compatibility-and-automation.md)).
This keeps a checked-in file **byte-stable across commits** (NBGV's per-commit patch height would
otherwise churn it on every build) so a diff means a *real* composition change, not noise.

### Resolved twin `obj/koan.lock.resolved.json`

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 1,
  "app": { "name": "S5.Recs", "koan": "0.17", "tfm": "net10.0" },
  "modules": [ { "id": "Koan.Core", "version": "0.17" } /* … */ ],
  "elections": { "data:default": { "adapter": "postgres", "via": "reference-priority", "priority": 14 } },
  "configKeys": [ "Koan:Data:Postgres:ConnectionString" ],
  "entities": [ { "type": "Anime", "traits": [] } ]
}
```

`configKeys` records the **keys** consumed under the `Koan:` namespace — **never the values** (a
connection string's *path* appears; its secret never does).

## Reference = Intent

Referencing a package that depends on `Sylin.Koan.Core` is the whole opt-in: NuGet imports
`buildTransitive/Sylin.Koan.Core.targets`, which writes `koan.lock.json` after `Build` for **app**
projects (`OutputType=Exe`). Force it on or off with `$(KoanComposition)`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <KoanComposition>true</KoanComposition>   <!-- or false to opt a project out -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

> **Source-checkout note.** A `ProjectReference` does not import a referenced package's build assets.
> Koan's FirstUse and GoldenJourney source contracts import the same target centrally through the
> repository build, while their package-only copies receive it through `buildTransitive`. Other
> source-only framework dogfood projects must explicitly import the target or set
> `KoanComposition=false`; package consumers need no project-file ceremony.

## Drift gates

Two independent checks, each catching a different failure:

- **Build-time drift** — `scripts/compare-koan-lock.ps1` fails if a build refreshed a tracked
  `koan.lock.json` that was not committed (composition changed but not recorded). It is leg **E** of
  `scripts/green-ratchet.ps1`, so the PR gate enforces it (CI == local).
- **Boot-time drift** — the host compares the checked-in file against what actually loaded and prints
  `lockfile ok | DRIFT(<keys>)`. Drift keys read as a diff: `+Id` loaded but not locked, `-Id` locked
  but absent, `Id@ver` changed.

## Enrich the twin (advanced)

Pillars contribute their runtime-resolved sections through a discovered seam — referencing the pillar
is what makes the lockfile describe it. The data pillar ships the `data:default` election this way; a
custom pillar can add its own:

<!-- validate -->
```csharp
using System;
using Koan.Core.Composition;

// Discovered automatically (the interface is [KoanDiscoverable]); no manual registration.
public sealed class MyPillarComposition : IKoanCompositionContributor
{
    public void Contribute(KoanCompositionBuilder builder, IServiceProvider services)
    {
        builder.AddElection("search:default", adapter: "opensearch", via: "reference-priority");
        builder.AddCapability("search:opensearch", new[] { "query.filter", "vector.knn" });
        // Contributions are best-effort: never throw — a failure must not break the boot report.
    }
}
```

## Limits (by design, honest)

- **Capabilities** are negotiated per-repository (connection-bound), so the twin omits them in this
  version; query them live at `/.well-known/aggregates`.
- **Entities** reflect what was resolved by boot (entity configs populate lazily on first
  `Entity<T>` access), so the list is typically what the app touched during startup.
- The resolved twin and the boot-line comparison need a content root, so they apply to host-based apps
  (`WebApplication` / generic `Host`) in development (`ContentRootPath` = the project directory). The
  build-time `koan.lock.json` is produced for supported package applications and Koan's executable
  source contracts regardless of whether the app is later started.
