# OpenGraph social cards

Give a Koan SPA per-route social cards (and a per-route `<title>` and canonical link)
without server-side rendering. Social crawlers do not run JavaScript, so a SPA that
serves one static shell on every route unfurls every shared link as the same generic
card. This pillar injects the right `<head>` block into the shell on the crawler path,
keyed off your entities.

See the decision record at [WEB-0070](../decisions/WEB-0070-opengraph-social-cards.md)
for the rationale.

## 1. Reference the package

Add a reference to `Sylin.Koan.Web.OpenGraph`. Reference = availability: the package contributes its Web pipeline
behavior through the application's existing `AddKoan()` composition. It remains inert until a shell is configured;
Entity-specific metadata additionally requires a card declaration.

## 2. Register a card per entity type

Inside `AddKoan(() => ...)`, or in `KoanModule.Register` for a reusable application capability, declare one card per
type. Each `For<T>` supplies the three facts the framework cannot infer: the route
template (your SPA router owns it), the resolver (token to entity), and the
projections (entity to card fields).

```csharp
using Koan.Web.OpenGraph;

builder.Services.AddKoan(() => SocialCards
    .For<Work>("/work/{id}/{slug}", id => Work.Get(id))
        .Title(w => w.Name)
        .Description(w => w.Summary)
        .Image(w => CardImage.Recipe("share-card", w.CoverMediaId))
        .Url(w => $"/work/{w.Id}")
        .Type("article")
    .For<Article>("/articles/{id}/{slug}", id => Article.Get(id))
        .Title(a => a.Title)
        .Description(a => a.Excerpt)
        .Image(a => CardImage.Recipe("share-card", a.CoverMediaId)));
```

The primary token is the first route parameter (the entity id); the resolver is
uniformly `T.Get(id)`. Any further segments (the decorative SEO `{slug}`) are matched
and discarded, so `/work/{id}/{slug}`, `/work/{id}`, and a request like
`/work/{id}/anything` all resolve off the same id. The entity type must be a `Koan`
entity (`T : Entity<T>`).

Card registrations and lifecycle plans belong to the composing host. The registry retains the resolver and selectors
for request-time cold fill and lifecycle warming, so they should not close over a service provider, scope, runtime
service, options snapshot, adapter, or disposable. Use `id => T.Get(id)` so Entity resolution selects the active Koan
runtime when the resolver executes, and keep selectors pure over the entity value. A second host receives a separate
registry and may independently declare the same Entity type; no reset API is necessary.

Because the selectors are pure functions over the loaded entity, per-entity-state
customization is a one-line conditional, which an attribute scheme could not express:

```csharp
.Image(w => w.Images.Count >= 2
    ? CardImage.Recipe("share-card-duo", w.Images[0].MediaId)
    : CardImage.Recipe("share-card", w.CoverMediaId))
```

### CardImage

`CardImage` composes an `og:image` URL; it renders nothing.

| Factory | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| `CardImage.Recipe("share-card", mediaId)` | `/media/{mediaId}/share-card` |
| `CardImage.Raw(mediaId)` | `/media/{mediaId}` |
| `CardImage.Url("https://...")` | the explicit URL |
| `CardImage.Default` | `OpenGraphOptions.DefaultImage` |

A null or empty `mediaId` collapses to the default. The middleware promotes the path
to an absolute URL using the request scheme and host.

## 3. Configure `Koan:Web:OpenGraph`

```jsonc
{
  "Koan": {
    "Web": {
      "OpenGraph": {
        "ShellPath": "wwwroot/index.html",
        "SiteName": "My Site",
        "DefaultImage": "/img/social-default.png",
        "DefaultDescription": "...",
        // Optional. Defaults shown.
        "PlaceholderMarker": "<!--KOAN_OPENGRAPH-->",
        "DefaultType": "website",
        "TwitterCard": "summary_large_image",
        "EmitTitleElement": true,
        "EmitCanonical": true,
        "EmitTwitterTags": true,
        "MaxTitleLength": 70,
        "MaxDescriptionLength": 200
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`ShellPath` points at the SPA shell on disk. Place the marker in the shell where the
block should land; if the marker is absent, the block is inserted before `</head>`.

```html
<head>
  <!--KOAN_OPENGRAPH-->
</head>
```

## 4. Keep the application fallback

The package inserts its middleware automatically at Koan's `BeforeRouting` boundary. The application continues to own
its normal static-file and SPA fallback behavior; no `UseOpenGraphCards()` call is supported or required.

On a `GET` navigation (Accept includes `text/html`) the middleware injects the card
and short-circuits. Asset paths, `/api` paths, non-html requests, and the disabled
state all pass through to your fallback untouched.

Because Koan contributes OpenGraph before routing, matching navigations are evaluated before an application fallback.
The fallback remains authoritative whenever OpenGraph passes through.

## How it behaves

- Matched route, known entity: the entity's `<title>`, canonical, og: and twitter:
  tags are injected.
- Unknown id or slug: the default card (site name, default image, default
  description) is injected. Never an error.
- Unmatched route: the default card.
- Every emitted value is HTML-encoded; title and description are truncated to their
  configured maxima.

## Caching

Each card is materialized as a `SocialCardSnapshot` entity marked `[Cacheable]`, so it
reuses the cache pillar (L1/L2 plus coherence) when a cache adapter is referenced, and
falls back to a plain persisted read otherwise. The snapshot is kept fresh by entity
Lifecycle: it is rebuilt when the source entity is saved and removed when the
source entity is deleted. The request path reads the snapshot and lazily fills it on a
miss, so the common case is a cache read plus a string replace.

## What this is not

No SSR or prerender, no headless browser, no user-agent sniffing, no routing
ownership. It is string injection into one static shell. oEmbed, JSON-LD, and sitemap
generation are out of scope.
