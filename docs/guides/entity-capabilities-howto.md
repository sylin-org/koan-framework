# Koan Entity Capabilities: Your Complete Guide

This guide walks you through Koan's data layer, from your first `todo.Save()` to production-scale multi-provider applications with streaming, transactions, and batch operations. Think of it as a conversation with a colleague who's been down this path before—we'll start simple and build your confidence as we go.

Each section follows a gentle rhythm: **Concepts** (what is this?), **Recipe** (how do I set it up?), **Sample** (show me the code), and **Usage Scenarios** (when would I use this?). By the end, you'll know how to choose the right patterns for your needs.

## 0. Prerequisites

Before we dive in, let's get your environment ready. Don't worry—Koan is designed to work with sensible defaults, so you can skip configuration and come back to it later.

**Add the Koan baseline packages:**

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Core" Version="0.6.3" />
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Core" Version="0.6.3" />
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Abstractions" Version="0.6.3" />
```

**Pick at least one data adapter** (SQLite is great for getting started):

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Connector.Sqlite" Version="0.6.3" />
```

**Optional:** Configure your default data source in `appsettings.json`. Koan works without this—it'll use in-memory storage—but when you're ready for persistence:

```json
{
  "Koan": {
    "Data": {
      "Sources": {
        "Default": {
          "Adapter": "sqlite",
          "ConnectionString": "Data Source=app.db"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Boot the runtime** in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddKoan();  // That's it—Koan handles the rest
var app = builder.Build();
await app.RunAsync();
```

Everything below builds on this foundation. Let's go!

---

## 1. Foundations: Your First Entity

**Concepts**

Think of `Entity<T>` as your data model with superpowers. It gives you:
- Auto-generated GUID v7 IDs (time-ordered, no collisions)
- Instance methods for lifecycle (`Save`, `Remove`)
- Static helpers for querying (`Get`, `All`, `Query`, `Count`)
- Provider-agnostic persistence (works with SQLite, Postgres, MongoDB, and more)

Everything routes through your configured data source—no manual repository plumbing.

**Recipe**

You've already got the packages from Prerequisites. No additional setup needed!

**Sample**

Let's create a simple todo entity and save it:

```csharp
public class Todo : Entity<Todo>
{
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public bool Completed { get; set; }
    public DateTimeOffset? DueDate { get; set; }
}

// Create and save a todo
var todo = new Todo
{
    Title = "Learn Koan Entity patterns",
    DueDate = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(7)
};
await todo.Save();  // That's it! Auto-persisted to your configured adapter

// Fetch it back
var fetched = await Todo.Get(todo.Id);
Console.WriteLine($"Found: {fetched?.Title}");

// Update it
fetched!.Completed = true;
await fetched.Save();  // Same method for create and update

// Remove it when done
await fetched.Remove();
```

**Why this works:** Koan tracks whether an entity is new or existing, automatically choosing insert vs update behind the scenes.

**Custom Keys**

Most of the time, GUID v7 IDs are perfect—they're time-ordered and distributed-safe. But if you need custom keys (like auto-increment integers or composite keys):

```csharp
public class Product : Entity<Product, int>
{
    public override int Id { get; set; }  // You control the ID
    public string Name { get; set; } = "";
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// You assign the ID explicitly
var product = new Product
{
    Id = 42,
    Name = "Widget",
    Price = 19.99m
};
await product.Save();
```

**Sharing Shape Across Entities**

First decide whether the types are one searchable family or merely reuse the same properties. That
decision controls whether Koan gives them one physical set or separate sets.

**Use one Entity root when every variant belongs in the same table or collection.** Put every field
that must participate in portable filtering, sorting, counting, paging, indexes, or persistence
policy on the root. Then close each variant through the generated same-name family companion:

```csharp
public class Media : Entity<Media>
{
    public string Kind { get; set; } = "";
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
}

public sealed class Anime : Media<Anime>
{
    public int? Episodes { get; set; }
}

public sealed class Manga : Media<Manga>
{
    public int? Volumes { get; set; }
    public int? Chapters { get; set; }
}
```

You declare only those three application types. Koan's source generator supplies the
`Media<TVariant>` companion from the `Media : Entity<Media>` root; no persistence attribute,
converter, or provider option is required.

Use the variant for typed point access and writes:

```csharp
var saved = await new Anime
{
    Kind = "Anime",
    Title = "Cowboy Bebop",
    Episodes = 26
}.Save(ct);

Anime? anime = await Anime.Get(saved.Id, ct);
```

`Anime.Get` returns `Anime?`, including `Episodes`. Loading the same identifier through
`Media.Get` returns `Media?`, whose runtime object is still `Anime`.

Use the root for operations over the complete family:

```csharp
var animeRows = await Media.Query(item => item.Kind == "Anime", ct);
var firstPage = await Media.Page(1, 25, ct);
var everything = await Media.All(ct);
```

Anime, Manga, and plain Media records share the Media repository, table, or collection. Root filters,
sorts, counts, and pages therefore execute once and retain the selected adapter's normal pushdown
behavior. Derived-only members such as `Episodes` are persisted payload; move a member to `Media`
when it needs portable set-wide query or policy semantics. Record-local write stamps and field
transforms follow the runtime record type, so leaf timestamp/classification members are not skipped.

Close the variant with itself: write `Anime : Media<Anime>`, not `Anime : Media` or
`Anime : Media<Manga>`. Koan validates the family shape and reports a correction instead of silently
creating another repository.

Koan stores a reserved `__koan_type` hint for every record in a known family, including a plain root
record. It never infers a CLR type from `Kind`, a property name, or the presence of `Episodes`. This
matters when adopting polymorphic roots over existing data:

- A discriminator-free row loaded through `Media` materializes as `Media`.
- `Anime.Get(id)` can use its explicit target to load a known discriminator-free Anime row when the adapter
  materializes that row on demand. Eager file stores require a migration/backfill because they hydrate before the
  point-read target exists.
- A mixed root query cannot safely classify old discriminator-free derived JSON. Migrate or backfill
  those rows before relying on variant identity in root reads.

**Use a generic shared base when the types need separate physical sets.**

```csharp
public abstract class CatalogEntity<T> : Entity<T> where T : CatalogEntity<T>, new()
{
    public string? Shared { get; set; }
}

public sealed class Package : CatalogEntity<Package> { }
public sealed class Mirror : CatalogEntity<Mirror>
{
    public string? Extra { get; set; }
}
```

`Package` and `Mirror` are sibling Entity roots. They reuse shape but have independent repositories,
tables or collections, queries, and identifiers.

**Rule of thumb:** use `Entity<Self>` or a shared generic base for an independent set. Use
`Root<Self>` when `Self` is a variant in the root's shared set.

Entity property names must also be unique without relying on case. A model with inherited `Id` and a
second property named `id`, for example, has no portable identity across JSON and providers with
different case-sensitivity rules. Koan rejects that model on first use, before opening a repository,
and names the properties to rename. Normal PascalCase properties still accept unambiguous camelCase or
mixed-case filter input.

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Web APIs:** Entity<T> eliminates boilerplate. No manual repositories, no hand-written CRUD.
- **Background jobs:** Save entities directly in job handlers—Koan manages connections and transactions.
- **Multi-provider apps:** Same `todo.Save()` code works whether you're using SQLite locally or Postgres in production.

---

## 2. Batch Retrieval: Avoiding the N+1 Trap

**Concepts**

Here's a common mistake: loading related entities one-by-one in a loop. It's called the N+1 problem, and it kills performance. Koan's batch retrieval fetches multiple entities in a single query—preserving order and handling missing IDs gracefully.

**When you need this:** Loading playlist items, fetching related records, validating a list of IDs.

**Recipe**

No new packages needed. Batch retrieval is built into `Entity<T>`.

**Sample**

```csharp
// ❌ The N+1 anti-pattern (don't do this!)
var todos = new List<Todo?>();
foreach (var id in collectionIds)  // 100 IDs = 100 database queries!
{
    todos.Add(await Todo.Get(id, ct));
}

// ✅ Efficient batch retrieval (1 database query!)
var ids = new[] { id1, id2, id3, id4, id5 };
var todos = await Todo.Get(ids, ct);
// Result: [Todo?, Todo?, null, Todo?, Todo?]
// Third ID wasn't found—Koan returns null in that position

// Filter out missing items if needed
var foundTodos = todos.Where(t => t != null).Select(t => t!).ToList();
```

**Order matters:** Batch Get returns results in the same order as your input IDs. This is perfect for paginated collections where order is meaningful.

**Performance Benefits**

```
Single Get: 1 query, ~2ms
Batch Get (100 IDs): 1 query with IN clause, ~5ms
Loop of 100 Gets: 100 queries, ~200ms+

Speedup: 40x faster!
```

**Real-World Example: Paginated Playlist**

```csharp
// Load a playlist page
var playlist = await Playlist.Get(playlistId, ct);
var pageIds = playlist.SongIds
    .Skip((page - 1) * pageSize)
    .Take(pageSize)
    .ToList();

// Single batch query for the entire page
var songs = await Song.Get(pageIds, ct);

// Order is preserved—songs appear in playlist order
return songs.Where(s => s != null).Select(s => s!).ToList();
```

**Partition-aware batches:**

```csharp
// Load archived todos from a specific partition
using (EntityContext.Partition("archive"))
{
    var archivedTodos = await Todo.Get(todoIds, ct);
}
```

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Collection/playlist pagination:** Fetch a page of pre-ordered items efficiently
- **Relationship navigation:** Load all related entities without N+1 queries
- **Bulk validation:** Check which IDs exist before processing
- **API responses:** Hydrate response DTOs with minimal database round-trips

**Pro tip:** If you're fetching items in a loop, ask yourself: "Could I batch this?" The answer is usually yes.

---

## 3. Querying and Pagination

**Concepts**

Koan gives you three ways to query:
1. **LINQ expressions** (`Query(t => t.Completed)`)—type-safe, IntelliSense-friendly
2. **String queries** (`Query("status == 'active'")`)—useful for dynamic filters
3. **Pagination helpers** (`FirstPage()`, `Page(2, 20)`)—built-in page support

Providers that support server-side LINQ (Postgres, MongoDB, SQL Server) execute filters in the database. Others (JSON, InMemory) fall back to client-side evaluation—Koan warns you when this happens.

**Recipe**

Same packages as before. For best performance, use adapters with `IQueryRepository` support (Postgres, MongoDB, SQL Server).

**Sample**

**Basic LINQ queries:**

```csharp
// Find overdue todos
var overdue = await Todo.Query(t =>
    !t.Completed &&
    t.DueDate.HasValue &&
    t.DueDate.Value < DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
    ct
);

// String-based query (useful for user-built filters)
var readings = await SensorReading.Query("temperature > 25 AND location == 'warehouse'", ct);
```

**Pagination:**

```csharp
// Get the first page (page 1, 20 items)
var firstPage = await Todo.FirstPage(pageSize: 20, ct);

// Get a specific page
var page3 = await Todo.Page(page: 3, size: 20, ct);

// Combine with filtering
var completed = await Todo.Query(
    t => t.Completed,
    new QueryDefinition { Page = 2, PageSize = 50 },
    ct
);
```

**Pagination with total counts (for UI controls):**

```csharp
var result = await Todo.QueryWithCount(
    t => t.ProjectId == projectId,
    new QueryDefinition { Page = 1, PageSize = 20 }.WithSort<Todo>("-Created"), // "-" prefix = descending
    ct
);

Console.WriteLine($"Showing {result.Items.Count} of {result.TotalCount} todos");
// Output: Showing 20 of 347 todos
```

**Streaming large datasets:**

When a result is too large to materialize as one Entity list, use provider-bounded streaming on a
qualified adapter:

```csharp
// Consumer-paced provider pages on a qualified adapter
await foreach (var reading in SensorReading.QueryStream(
    reading => reading.Timestamp > cutoff,
    batchSize: 500,  // At most 500 Koan-visible candidates per provider page
    ct: ct))
{
    await ProcessReading(reading, ct);
}
```

This requires `ProviderBoundedPaging` (SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, CockroachDB, MongoDB, or
Couchbase). InMemory, JSON, and Redis reject before query/yield. The batch bounds Koan-visible
candidates; it does not promise snapshot consistency, mutation safety, or opaque-driver memory.

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Web APIs:** Paginate results for list endpoints (`GET /api/todos?page=2&size=20`)
- **Reports:** On a qualified adapter, process large datasets without materializing the complete Entity source
- **Dashboards:** Query with counts for "Showing X of Y" UI controls
- **Admin tools:** Use string queries for user-built dynamic filters

**Pro tip:** If you're rendering a grid or list, you almost always want `QueryWithCount()` for pagination controls.

## 4. Counting Strategies: Fast vs Exact

**Concepts**

How many todos do you have? Koan gives you three counting strategies so you can state the accuracy
you need:

- **Exact:** Request an exact result
- **Fast:** Request an adapter-specific fast path; the result may be an estimate
- **Optimized:** Let the adapter choose its optimized count path

Think of it like this: counting jelly beans in a jar—you can count each one (Exact) or estimate from the jar's size (Fast).

**When to use each:**
- Dashboard summaries? **Fast** can fit when an estimate is acceptable and the selected adapter supports it
- Business-critical inventory check? **Exact** is essential
- General use? **Optimized** is the default; verify the selected adapter's behavior for your workload

**Recipe**

No new packages. Count strategies are built into Entity<T>.

**Sample**

**Simple counts:**

```csharp
// Default: pass CountStrategy.Optimized to the selected adapter
var total = await Todo.Count;

// Explicit exact count (guaranteed accuracy)
var exact = await Todo.Count.Exact(ct);

// Explicit adapter-specific fast path; the result may be an estimate
var fast = await Todo.Count.Fast(ct);

// Filtered count
var completed = await Todo.Count.Where(t => t.Completed, ct: ct);

// Filtered with explicit strategy
var urgent = await Todo.Count.Where(
    t => t.Priority > 3,
    CountStrategy.Fast,
    ct: ct
);

// Count a specific partition
var archivedCount = await Todo.Count.Partition("archive", ct: ct);
```

Count cost, accuracy, and optimization are adapter-specific. Benchmark the elected adapter and
dataset rather than relying on cross-provider timings.

**When to use each strategy:**

```csharp
// ✅ Pagination UI (fast is fine)
var totalPages = (await Todo.Count.Fast(ct) + pageSize - 1) / pageSize;

// ✅ Dashboard summary (estimates OK)
var stats = new
{
    Total = await Todo.Count.Fast(ct),
    Completed = await Todo.Count.Where(t => t.Completed, CountStrategy.Fast, ct: ct),
    Pending = await Todo.Count.Where(t => !t.Completed, CountStrategy.Fast, ct: ct)
};

// ✅ Business logic (exact required!)
var exactInventory = await Product.Count.Where(
    p => p.InStock && p.WarehouseId == warehouseId,
    CountStrategy.Exact,
    ct: ct
);
if (exactInventory < reorderThreshold)
    await TriggerRestock(ct);
```

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Dashboards:** Use Fast for real-time stats that refresh every few seconds
- **Pagination:** Fast counts power "page 1 of 42" without blocking
- **Critical operations:** Exact counts for financial reconciliation, inventory
- **Default case:** Use Optimized—let Koan choose Fast when safe, Exact when necessary

**Pro tip:** If you're showing approximate totals to users ("~1.2M results"), Fast is perfect. Save Exact for when accuracy truly matters.

---

## 5. Batch Operations and Lifecycle Hooks

**Concepts**

You've learned to save single entities. But what about bulk imports? Product catalogs? Historical migrations? That's where batch operations shine.

Koan also gives you **lifecycle hooks**—think of them as middleware for your entities. Want to validate titles before save? Auto-format fields after load? Prevent accidental ID changes? Hooks handle it declaratively.

**Recipe**

Dependencies already covered. Lifecycle is part of `Koan.Data.Core`.

**Sample**

**Bulk saves:**

```csharp
// Seed 1,000 todos in one batch
var todos = Enumerable.Range(1, 1000)
    .Select(i => new Todo
    {
        Title = $"Task {i}",
        Completed = i % 5 == 0  // Every 5th is completed
    })
    .ToList();

await todos.Save(ct);  // Single bulk insert—much faster than 1000 individual saves
```

**Batch operations (add/update/delete):**

```csharp
// Combine multiple operations in one transaction
await Todo.Batch()
    .Add(new Todo { Title = "New task" })
    .Update(existingId, todo => todo.Completed = true)
    .Delete(oldId)
    .SaveAsync(ct);
```

**Lifecycle policy:**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKoan(() =>
    Todo.Lifecycle
        .BeforeUpsert(ctx =>
    {
        ctx.Protect(nameof(Todo.Id));
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(ctx.Current.Title))
            return ctx.Cancel("Todo must have a title");
        if (ctx.Current.Title.Length > 200)
            return ctx.Cancel("Title too long (max 200 chars)");
        return ctx.Proceed();
    })
        .AfterLoad(ctx =>
        {
            if (ctx.Current.Title != null)
                ctx.Current.Title = ctx.Current.Title.Trim();
        }));
```

**How hooks work:**
1. `AddKoan(...)` owns the plan for this host; no static reset or registrar is required.
2. `ctx.Protect(name)` prevents later handlers from mutating the captured value.
3. `BeforeUpsert` validates before save; `ctx.Cancel(reason)` rejects before persistence.
4. `AfterLoad` formats the materialized application instance without persisting it.

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Bulk imports:** Process CSV files, API responses, or migrations in batches
- **Data validation:** Enforce business rules before persistence
- **Audit trails:** Log changes in `BeforeUpdate` hooks
- **Display formatting:** Auto-trim, capitalize, or format fields after load
- **Protection:** Prevent accidental ID or audit field changes

**Pro tip:** Lifecycle hooks keep business logic close to your data model. No need to remember validation in every controller—define it once in the entity lifecycle.

---

## 6. Bulk Removal: Choosing Your Strategy

**Concepts**

Eventually, you'll need to delete a lot of data—test cleanup, archival, tenant deletion. Koan gives you three strategies:

- **Safe:** Always fires lifecycle hooks (audit trails, cleanup logic)
- **Fast:** Bypasses hooks for 10-250x performance (TRUNCATE, DROP, etc.)
- **Optimized:** Preserves configured remove Lifecycle; otherwise delegates optimization to the provider

Here's the key insight: configured remove Lifecycle makes `Optimized` use the safe per-entity path.
Explicit `Fast` is the only intentional lifecycle bypass.

**Quick decision:**
- Need audit trail or cleanup logic? → **Safe**
- Test cleanup or temp data? → **Optimized** (default)
- Know hooks aren't needed? → **Fast** (explicit)

**Recipe**

Same packages as always. Providers with `DataCaps.Write.FastRemove` (Postgres, SQL Server, MongoDB, SQLite, Redis) support fast strategies.

**Sample**

**Basic removal:**

```csharp
// Default: Optimized (preserves configured remove Lifecycle)
var count = await Todo.RemoveAll(ct);

// Explicit Safe (always fires hooks)
var count = await Todo.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Safe, ct);

// Explicit Fast (maximum performance, no hooks)
var count = await Todo.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Fast, ct);

// Remove from specific partition
var archived = await Todo.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Optimized, "archive", ct);

// Scoped removal via EntityContext
using (EntityContext.Partition("temp-data"))
{
    await Todo.RemoveAll(ct);  // Removes only from temp-data partition
}
```

**Performance comparison (1 million rows):**

| Provider   | Safe       | Fast/Optimized | Implementation              | Speedup |
|------------|------------|----------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | ~45 sec    | ~200ms         | `TRUNCATE TABLE`            | 225x    |
| SQL Server | ~38 sec    | ~150ms         | `TRUNCATE TABLE`            | 253x    |
| MongoDB    | ~52 sec    | ~300ms         | Drop + recreate indexes     | 173x    |
| SQLite     | ~25 sec    | ~2 sec         | `DELETE` + `VACUUM`         | 12.5x   |
| Redis      | ~18 sec    | ~800ms         | `UNLINK` (async)            | 22.5x   |

**When to use each:**

```csharp
// ✅ Test cleanup (Optimized is perfect)
[Fact]
public async Task BulkImportTest()
{
    await Todo.RemoveAll(ct);  // Fast cleanup between tests
    var todos = GenerateTestData(1000);
    await todos.Save(ct);
    // ... assertions
}

// ✅ Production tenant deletion (Safe required for audit!)
public async Task DeleteTenant(string tenantId, CancellationToken ct)
{
    using (EntityContext.Partition($"tenant-{tenantId}"))
    {
        // Explicit Safe ensures audit hooks fire
        await Order.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Safe, ct);
        await Customer.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Safe, ct);
        await Invoice.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Safe, ct);
    }
}

// ✅ Known no-audit scenario (Fast for max speed)
public async Task PurgeArchivedLogs(CancellationToken ct)
{
    using (EntityContext.Partition("archive-2023"))
    {
        await Log.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Fast, ct);  // No audit needed
    }
}
```

**Important:** `Fast` explicitly bypasses remove Lifecycle. `Optimized` and `Safe` preserve it when
handlers are configured:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKoan(() =>
    Order.Lifecycle.BeforeRemove(async ctx =>
        {
            // Log deletion for compliance
            await AuditLog.RecordDeletion(ctx.Current.Id, ctx.Current.CustomerId);
            return ctx.Proceed();
        }));

// ✅ Optimized detects the configured remove Lifecycle and preserves it
await Order.RemoveAll(ct);

// ✅ Safe also guarantees per-entity Lifecycle
await Order.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Safe, ct);

// ⚠️ Fast is an explicit lifecycle bypass
await Order.RemoveAll(RemoveStrategy.Fast, ct);
```

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Test cleanup:** Optimized gives fast resets between tests
- **Production deletion:** Safe ensures audit trails for compliance
- **Archive purging:** Fast for known no-audit scenarios
- **Staging resets:** Optimized for quick environment resets

**Pro tip:** Check `Entity.SupportsFastRemove` to see if your provider supports fast strategies. In-memory and JSON adapters always use Safe (they're already fast).

## 7. Context Routing: Partitions, Sources, and Adapters

**Concepts**

So far, everything's been saved to your default data source. But real applications need more:
- **Multi-tenancy:** Isolate tenant data (`tenant-alpha`, `tenant-beta`)
- **Read replicas:** Query analytics sources without touching production
- **Provider mixing:** Cache in Redis, store in Postgres, archive in S3

Koan gives you three routing primitives:
- **Partition:** Logical suffix for multi-tenant isolation (`Todo#tenant-alpha`)
- **Source:** Named configuration pointing to a specific adapter+connection
- **Adapter:** Explicit provider override for one-off scenarios

**Rule:** Use Source XOR Adapter (never both). Partitions work with either.

**Recipe**

Reference adapter packages for each provider you want:
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Connector.Postgres" Version="0.6.3" />
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Connector.Mongo" Version="0.6.3" />
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Connector.Redis" Version="0.6.3" />
```

Configure sources in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Koan": {
    "Data": {
      "Sources": {
        "Default": {
          "Adapter": "sqlite",
          "ConnectionString": "Data Source=app.db"
        },
        "Analytics": {
          "Adapter": "postgres",
          "ConnectionString": "Host=analytics-db;Database=reporting"
        },
        "Cache": {
          "Adapter": "redis",
          "ConnectionString": "localhost:6379"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Sample**

**Partitions (multi-tenancy):**

```csharp
// Save to tenant-specific partition
using (EntityContext.Partition("tenant-alpha"))
{
    await new Todo { Title = "Alpha's todo" }.Save(ct);
}

using (EntityContext.Partition("tenant-beta"))
{
    await new Todo { Title = "Beta's todo" }.Save(ct);
}

// Query tenant data
using (EntityContext.Partition("tenant-alpha"))
{
    var alphaTodos = await Todo.All(ct);  // Only sees alpha's data
}
```

**Sources (read replicas, analytics):**

```csharp
// Write to production
await new Todo { Title = "Production todo" }.Save(ct);

// Read from analytics replica
using (EntityContext.Source("Analytics"))
{
    var stats = new
    {
        Total = await Todo.Count.Fast(ct),
        Completed = await Todo.Count.Where(t => t.Completed, ct: ct)
    };
}

// Cache frequently accessed data
using (EntityContext.Source("Cache"))
{
    var popularProducts = await Product.Query(
        p => p.ViewCount > 10000,
        ct
    );
}
```

**Adapters (one-off provider overrides):**

```csharp
// Usually you'd use Sources, but adapters work for quick tests
using (EntityContext.Adapter("mongo"))
{
    var mongoTodos = await Todo.All(ct);  // Fetches from MongoDB
}
```

**Nesting contexts:**

```csharp
// Combine routing primitives
using (EntityContext.Source("Analytics"))
using (EntityContext.Partition("cold-archive"))
{
    // Reads from Analytics source, cold-archive partition
    var archivedTodos = await Todo.All(ct);
}
```

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Multi-tenant SaaS:** Isolate customer data via partitions
- **Analytics:** Route read-heavy queries to dedicated replicas
- **Caching:** Store hot data in Redis, cold data in Postgres
- **Testing:** Switch to in-memory adapters for integration tests

**Pro tip:** Partitions are lightweight and fast. Use them generously for tenant isolation, feature flags, or A/B test cohorts.

## 8. Transaction Coordination

**Concepts**

Sometimes you need multiple operations to succeed or fail together—creating a project with initial tasks, transferring inventory between warehouses, or importing a batch of related records.

Koan's ambient transaction support coordinates entity operations across multiple adapters with best-effort atomicity. Operations are tracked in memory and executed on commit.

**Key features:**
- Auto-commit on dispose (minimal cognitive load)
- Named transactions for telemetry correlation
- Works across different adapters (best-effort)

**Recipe**

Add transaction support in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddKoan();
builder.Services.AddKoanTransactions(options =>
{
    options.AutoCommitOnDispose = true;  // Default: auto-commit when using block exits
    options.EnableTelemetry = true;      // Activity spans + logging
    options.MaxTrackedOperations = 10_000;  // Prevent unbounded growth
});
```

**Sample**

**Basic transaction (auto-commit):**

```csharp
// Auto-commits when using block exits
using (EntityContext.Transaction("create-project"))
{
    var project = new Project { Name = "My Project" };
    await project.Save(ct);

    var task1 = new Task { ProjectId = project.Id, Title = "Setup" };
    var task2 = new Task { ProjectId = project.Id, Title = "Configure" };

    await task1.Save(ct);
    await task2.Save(ct);

    // Auto-commits here when block exits
}
```

**Explicit control (rollback on validation failure):**

```csharp
using (EntityContext.Transaction("batch-import"))
{
    var imported = new List<Product>();

    foreach (var item in importData)
    {
        var product = new Product { Name = item.Name, Price = item.Price };
        await product.Save(ct);
        imported.Add(product);
    }

    // Validation check
    var duplicates = imported.GroupBy(p => p.Name).Where(g => g.Count() > 1);
    if (duplicates.Any())
    {
        await EntityContext.RollbackAsync(ct);  // Undo everything
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Duplicate product names detected");
    }

    await EntityContext.CommitAsync(ct);  // Explicit commit
}
```

**Cross-adapter coordination:**

```csharp
// Coordinate operations across SQLite and Postgres
using (EntityContext.Transaction("sync-cache-and-db"))
{
    // Save to primary database (default adapter)
    await userData.Save(ct);

    // Also save to cache (Redis)
    using (EntityContext.Source("Cache"))
    {
        await userCache.Save(ct);
    }

    // Both commit together
    await EntityContext.CommitAsync(ct);
}
```

**Checking transaction status:**

```csharp
if (EntityContext.InTransaction)
{
    var info = EntityContext.Capabilities;
    logger.LogInformation(
        "Transaction tracking {Count} operations across {Adapters} adapter(s)",
        info.TrackedOperationCount,
        info.Adapters.Length
    );
}
```

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Multi-step creation:** Projects with initial tasks, orders with line items
- **Data migrations:** Rollback on failure for consistency
- **Cross-adapter sync:** Coordinate primary + backup storage
- **Batch imports:** All-or-nothing import with validation

**Important notes:**

⚠️ **Best-effort atomicity:** Koan provides sequential execution with error reporting, not distributed transactions. If adapter A commits and adapter B fails, A won't auto-rollback.

⚠️ **No nested transactions:** Attempting to nest throws `InvalidOperationException`.

⚠️ **Infrastructure operations bypass transactions:** `RemoveAll()` and `Truncate()` execute immediately.

⚠️ **Memory tracking:** For huge batches (10,000+ ops), break into smaller transactions to avoid memory pressure.

**Pro tip:** Use auto-commit for simple scenarios. Only reach for explicit commit/rollback when you need conditional logic mid-transaction.

## 9. Advanced Transfers: Copy, Move, Mirror

**Concepts**

Moving data between partitions, sources, or adapters is common: archiving old records, hydrating analytics databases, migrating tenants. Hand-written loops are error-prone and verbose.

Koan's transfer DSL provides declarative copy, move, and mirror operations:
- **Copy:** Duplicate entities to another context
- **Move:** Copy bounded pages, then delete only identities whose destination batch returned an exact receipt
- **Mirror:** Make one side authoritative, or reconcile both sides with an explicit conflict policy

**Recipe**

Latest `Koan.Data.Core` (transfer builders in `Koan.Data.Core.Transfers`). Use
`Koan.Data.Abstractions.Annotations` for `[Timestamp]` conflict resolution.

**Sample**

**Copy (duplicate to another partition):**

```csharp
// Copy completed todos to archive partition
await Todo.Copy(t => t.Completed)
    .To(partition: "archive")
    .Batch(500)
    .Audit(batch => logger.LogInformation("Archived {Count} todos", batch.BatchCount))
    .Run(ct);
```

**Move (transfer then delete):**

```csharp
// Move old todos from hot storage to cold
await Todo.Move()
    .From(partition: "hot")
    .To(adapter: "postgres", partition: "cold")
    .Batch(500)
    .Run(ct);
```

**Mirror (bidirectional sync):**

```csharp
// Keep transactional and reporting databases in sync
await Todo.Mirror(mode: MirrorMode.Bidirectional)
    .To(source: "Analytics")
    .Conflict(MirrorConflict.Latest)
    .Batch(500)
    .Run(ct);

// Push production records to analytics
await Todo.Mirror(mode: MirrorMode.Push)
    .To(source: "Analytics")
    .Run(ct);
```

**Filtered transfer:**

```csharp
// Copy only important todos
await Todo.Copy(todo => todo.Important)
    .To(partition: "priority")
    .Batch(500)
    .Run(ct);
```

**Inspecting results:**

```csharp
var result = await Todo.Move()
    .From(partition: "temp")
    .To(partition: "archive")
    .Run(ct);

logger.LogInformation(
    "Copied {Copied}, Deleted {Deleted}, Warnings: {Warnings}",
    result.CopiedCount,
    result.DeletedCount,
    result.Warnings.Count
);

// Check for conflicts (Mirror operations)
if (result.HasConflicts)
{
    foreach (var conflict in result.Conflicts)
    {
        logger.LogWarning(
            "Conflict on {Id}: {Reason}",
            conflict.Id,
            conflict.Reason
        );
    }
}
```

**Usage Scenarios**

- **Test data:** Copy production data to staging for realistic tests
- **Archival:** Move old records to cold storage on schedule
- **Analytics:** Mirror transactional data to reporting databases
- **Migrations:** Transfer data between adapters during provider changes

`Batch(...)` is one portable bound: it limits each provider candidate page, each destination mutation,
and each deferred identity-delete batch. An adapter must prove provider-side paging and ordering before
the first source query. A returned destination or delete count must exactly match its admitted batch;
an ambiguous exception is surfaced and never replayed.

Move journals confirmed identities in delete-on-close bounded records, so it does not retain the selected
dataset in application memory or mutate an offset-paged source while reading it. Use Jobs and an
application-owned checkpoint when work must survive process failure or resume across runs.

**Pro tip:** `.Audit()` reports destination write batches and a final summary. It is observability,
not a checkpoint or resume token.

---

## 10. Streaming Workloads and Integration

**Concepts**

For large datasets or long-running operations, use a qualified Entity stream for an explicit
business operation, or Jobs when the work needs durable execution and retry.

**When to use:**
- **Entity stream:** Apply an application-owned, business-named operation with consumer-paced reads
- **Jobs:** Scheduled nightly transfers, archival, or DR sync

**Recipe**

Add only the pillar package that owns the capability you need:

```bash
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.AI
dotnet add package Sylin.Koan.Jobs
```

**Sample**

**Embedding lifecycle for ordinary writes:**

```csharp
[Embedding(Async = true)]
public sealed class Recommendation : Entity<Recommendation>
{
    public string Content { get; set; } = "";
}

await recommendation.Save(ct); // persistence schedules embedding through Entity Lifecycle
```

**Explicit finite-set backfill:**

```csharp
var stale = await Recommendation.Query(
    recommendation => recommendation.NeedsReindex,
    ct);

var result = await EmbeddingMigrator.ReEmbed(stale, batchSize: 200, ct: ct);
if (!result.Success)
{
    logger.LogWarning(
        "Re-indexed {Succeeded}/{Total} recommendations",
        result.SuccessfulEntities,
        result.TotalEntities);
}
```

`ReEmbed` reports operation outcomes and does not imply collection atomicity or retry. Use
`ReEmbedAll<T>` for an intentional whole-collection model transition.

**Job for nightly archive:**

```csharp
public sealed class ArchiveOldTodosJob
    : Entity<ArchiveOldTodosJob>, IKoanJob<ArchiveOldTodosJob>
{
    public DateTimeOffset Cutoff { get; init; }

    public static async Task Execute(
        ArchiveOldTodosJob job,
        JobContext context,
        CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await Todo.Move(todo => todo.Completed && todo.CompletedDate < job.Cutoff)
            .From(partition: "active")
            .To(partition: "archive")
            .Run(ct);

        await context.Progress(1, "Archive complete");
    }
}

await new ArchiveOldTodosJob
{
    Cutoff = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(-90)
}.Job.Submit(ct: ct);
```

**Usage Scenarios**

- **AI lifecycle and migration:** Embed ordinary saves automatically; make explicit backfills observable
- **Nightly transfers:** Archive old data, sync replicas
- **Scheduled workflows:** Run transfers from Jobs; checkpoint and resume policy remains application-owned

---

## 11. AI and Vector Extensions

**Concepts**

Store embeddings directly on entities and integrate with shipped vector providers such as Weaviate
and Qdrant. The same `Entity<T>` patterns apply.

**Recipe**

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Vector.Abstractions" Version="0.6.3" />
<PackageReference Include="Koan.Data.Vector.Connector.Weaviate" Version="0.6.3" />
```

**Sample**

```csharp
public class MediaItem : Entity<MediaItem>
{
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public string Description { get; set; } = "";
    public float[]? Embedding { get; set; }
}

// Generate and store embedding
var media = await MediaItem.Get(mediaId, ct);
media.Embedding = await Koan.AI.Client.Embed($"{media.Title}\n\n{media.Description}", ct);
await media.Save(ct);

// Semantic search
var similar = await MediaItem.Query("vectorDistance < 0.15", ct);
```

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Symptom: N+1 query performance issues

**Cause:** Loading entities one-by-one in a loop
**Solution:** Use batch retrieval: `await Entity.Get(ids, ct)`
**Prevention:** Code review checklist: "Any loops fetching entities? Can we batch?"

### Symptom: Out of memory during large queries

**Cause:** Loading millions of records with `.All()` or `.Query()`
**Solution:** On a qualified adapter, use provider-bounded streaming: `AllStream(batchSize: 500, ct)` or `QueryStream()`
**Prevention:** Ask: "Could this dataset grow unbounded?" Then verify the adapter advertises
`DataCaps.Query.ProviderBoundedPaging` (runtime id `query.paging.providerBounded`); InMemory, JSON, and
Redis reject streaming rather than materialize
an unbounded fallback.

### Symptom: Slow pagination on large tables

**Cause:** Using `Count.Exact()` for every page load
**Solution:** Switch to `Count.Fast()` for pagination UI
**Prevention:** Reserve `Exact` for business-critical counts

### Symptom: RemoveAll() doesn't fire hooks

**Cause:** Default `Optimized` strategy uses `Fast` on capable providers
**Solution:** Use explicit `RemoveStrategy.Safe` when hooks required
**Prevention:** Audit lifecycle hooks—if BeforeRemove does important work, always use Safe

### Symptom: Transaction doesn't rollback across adapters

**Cause:** Best-effort atomicity—not true distributed transactions
**Solution:** Design for idempotency; use compensation logic if needed
**Prevention:** Document cross-adapter transaction limitations

### Symptom: "Client evaluation" warnings in logs

**Cause:** Provider doesn't support server-side LINQ for your query
**Solution:** Simplify query or switch to provider with LINQ support (Postgres, Mongo)
**Prevention:** Test queries against production-like data volumes

### Symptom: Partition data leaking between tenants

**Cause:** Forgot to set `EntityContext.Partition()` before query
**Solution:** Use middleware or filters to set partition automatically
**Prevention:** Add integration tests validating partition isolation

### Symptom: Koan rejects a polymorphic variant declaration

**Cause:** The variant does not close the generated family companion with itself—for example,
`class Anime : Media` or `class Anime : Media<Manga>`.
**Solution:** Declare the root as `Media : Entity<Media>` and the variant as
`Anime : Media<Anime>` (see Section 1, "Sharing Shape Across Entities").
**Prevention:** Use `Root<Self>` for a shared polymorphic set. Use `Entity<Self>` or a generic shared
base only when each type should own a separate set.

### Symptom: A legacy derived row loads as the root type

**Cause:** The stored row predates Koan's `__koan_type` source hint. A mixed root read cannot safely
infer the CLR variant from a domain field or payload shape.
**Solution:** Use a typed point read such as `Anime.Get(id)` when the expected variant is known, then
migrate or backfill legacy rows before depending on variant identity in `Media` queries.
**Prevention:** Save new records through their typed variant; Koan writes the source hint
automatically.

---

## Write-If-Changed Upserts

**Concept:** By default, `Upsert` always writes to the store and runs `AfterUpsert`, even when the
incoming data is byte-identical to what is already stored. This is correct for most scenarios. When
Lifecycle consumers perform expensive follow-up work, an unchanged re-crawl can create needless
work. `UpsertIfChanged` compares first and enters the normal Upsert/Lifecycle path only when the model
differs from its stored value.

**Semantics:**
- The current stored application value and caller's model are compared before Lifecycle.
- If they are byte-identical, persistence and all Upsert Lifecycle phases are skipped; the method returns `false`.
- If they differ, the normal canonical `Upsert` runs, including cancellation and all configured handlers.
- If the entity is new (no prior exists), or if the serialization fails for any reason, the write always proceeds (safe fallback).
- The method returns `true` when written, `false` when skipped.

**Recipe:**

```csharp
// opt in -- call instead of Upsert when skipping no-op writes matters
var written = await Article.UpsertIfChanged(article);
if (written)
{
    // downstream events were fired, cache was invalidated, etc.
}

// partition-aware variant
var written = await Article.UpsertIfChanged(article, tenantPartition);
```

**When to use:**
- Crawlers or sync pipelines that re-emit every record even when unchanged.
- Event-driven consumers where `AfterUpsert` triggers expensive fan-out (cache invalidation, notifications, indexing).
- High-frequency polling loops where most updates are no-ops.

**When NOT to use:**
- When `AfterUpsert` must always fire regardless of content (e.g., heartbeat updates, explicit re-triggers).
- When the entity has fields the serializer cannot capture faithfully (custom converters, computed properties set externally). In that case, `Upsert` is the safe default.

**Cost:** `UpsertIfChanged` always loads the prior before deciding whether to enter Lifecycle and write.
This is one extra read per call. On hot paths that almost always write, prefer `Upsert`.

## Next Steps

You've learned the fundamentals—from simple saves to capability-qualified streaming and transactions.
Here's where to go next:

**Immediate next actions:**
1. Try batch retrieval in your next API endpoint (replace loops with `Entity.Get(ids)`)
2. Add Fast counts to your dashboard (see the 1000x speedup)
3. On a qualified adapter, stream the Entity source for your next large export

**Explore related capabilities:**
- **Semantic search?** → [AI & Vector How-To](ai-vector-howto.md) (embeddings, hybrid search)
- **Multi-source deduplication?** → [Canon Capabilities](canon-capabilities-howto.md) (aggregation, identity graphs)
- **Partial updates?** → [Patch Capabilities](patch-capabilities-howto.md) (RFC 6902, merge-patch)

**Real-world examples:**
- `samples/journeys/GardenCoop/01-GardenJournal` - sensor binding and watering-reminder automation
- `samples/journeys/GardenCoop/02-LocalDiscovery` - the same application plus local Entity embedding and vector search

**Keep exploring:**
- Combine provider-bounded Entity streams with durable Jobs for large migrations
- Add lifecycle hooks to enforce business rules
- Use context routing for multi-tenant isolation

When in doubt, remember: Koan's entity-first patterns keep your code declarative, provider-agnostic, and ready to scale. Start simple, add complexity only when you need it.

**Streaming validation:** SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, CockroachDB, MongoDB, and Couchbase qualify;
InMemory, JSON, and Redis fail closed before query or yield.
