# Entity access and streaming

Koan gives one Entity three ways to leave the store, and they are not interchangeable: materialize the
set, iterate it, or ask for a numbered page. Choosing among them is choosing how much memory the call
may take and how consistent the result has to be, so the shape you write is the shape you meant.

Three properties decide most of it.

- **Streaming is earned, not assumed.** Only an adapter that advertises provider-bounded paging can
  serve an Entity stream; the rest refuse before yielding rather than quietly buffering the set.
- **Order is completed for you.** Koan validates the portable order you asked for and appends the
  Entity identifier as a provider-stable tie-breaker, so pages do not shuffle between reads. Ordering
  by that identifier yourself is not portable.
- **Offset pages drift under concurrent writes.** A row inserted between page 1 and page 2 shifts
  everything after it, so a set that changes under you is a set to stream.

Pass a `CancellationToken` to every one of them.

## Materialize everything (explicit)

```csharp
var all = await Product.All(ct); // full set; avoid for very large tables
```

## Async iteration (provider-bounded)

```csharp
await foreach (var product in Product.AllStream(batchSize: 500, ct: ct))
{
    await Process(product, ct);
}

await foreach (var ready in Product.QueryStream(
    product => product.Ready,
    batchSize: 250,
    ct: ct))
{
    await Process(ready, ct);
}
```

Koan requests one numbered candidate page, validates the adapter's execution report, then yields it
before requesting another. Consumer pace controls later requests; cancellation and early disposal
prevent later pages. Streams do not request totals.

`batchSize` bounds the candidate list visible to Koan. It does not describe opaque driver buffers or
make the complete operation snapshot-consistent. A residual predicate can run pointwise over each
bounded candidate page; the provider must still own the page bound and complete total order.

### Qualified adapters

| Stream behavior | Adapters |
|---|---|
| Provider-bounded numbered pages | SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, CockroachDB, MongoDB, Couchbase |
| Reject before query/yield | InMemory, JSON, Redis |

Unsupported execution throws `QueryStreamRejectedException` with the Entity, provider, stable reason,
and corrective action. Koan does not silently materialize a full source as a fallback.

A sort key whose type is a portable scalar -- an enum, or `bool`, `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`,
`int`, `long`, `decimal`, `double`, `DateTimeOffset`, `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`, `TimeSpan` -- compares
the same way on every backend, because the shared adapter matrix proves that value and null-order
contract.

Any other key still streams, stably and completely, on the store it runs against. What it does not
carry is agreement *across* backends: a string orders by collation, a nullable column by the
provider's null placement. Koan records that as a runtime fact naming the keys involved rather than
refusing the query -- an application that needs cross-backend agreement can see which keys to avoid,
and one that does not gets the order it actually asked for.

Koan separately adds the exact Entity identifier after validating caller ordering. The usual string
key is an opaque provider-stable tie-break, not a CLR or cross-provider collation promise, so an
explicit Entity-identifier sort rejects; a differently
cased business member does not replace it. Avoid CLR persistence models whose members differ only by
case, such as `Id` and `id`; their storage names are not portable across the qualified adapters.

## Explicit numbered paging

```csharp
const int pageSize = 100;
for (var pageNumber = 1; ; pageNumber++)
{
    var items = await Product.Page(pageNumber, pageSize, "Id", ct);
    foreach (var product in items) await Process(product, ct);
    if (items.Count < pageSize) break;
}
```

`Page` returns one materialized list and is useful for UI/request boundaries. Adapter fallback rules
still apply to ordinary paging; do not infer the stronger stream capability from this API. Koan has no
public cursor, Pager, continuation token, or resume API.

## Consistency boundary

Current streams use numbered offset pages. Concurrent inserts, deletes, or order-key changes can cause
skips or duplicates. They are not mutation-safe and do not create a snapshot. Use an application-owned
watermark/snapshot design when the business operation requires those guarantees.

The current provider contract represents `Skip`/`OFFSET` as `Int32`. Koan rejects a requested page
before provider I/O when `(pageNumber - 1) * pageSize` exceeds `Int32.MaxValue`.

The selected or rejected execution appears as `koan.data.stream.execution` in the shared facts
envelope (`/.well-known/Koan/facts` and `koan://facts`) after the first enumeration attempt.

## Guidance

- Use `AllStream`/`QueryStream` for consumer-paced processing on a qualified adapter.
- Treat a rejection as a capability mismatch; choose a qualified adapter or materialize explicitly.
- Use page endpoints for APIs to control latency and memory.
- Reserve `All()` for small sets or one-off maintenance scripts.
