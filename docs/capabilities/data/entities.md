# Entity capability hooks

Start here when a request names a business thing. `Entity<T>` is not merely a database row: it is the
shared application vocabulary that persistence, policy, HTTP, jobs, events, AI, storage, and agent
surfaces reuse.

```csharp
public sealed class Todo : Entity<Todo>
{
    public string Title { get; set; } = "";
    public bool Done { get; set; }
}

var todo = await new Todo { Title = "Ship it" }.Save(ct);
var open = await Todo.Query(item => !item.Done, ct);
```

## You need

| Piece | Package | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Koan application and Entity semantics | the application or foundation bundle | call `AddKoan()` once |
| One Entity store | [choose by topology](entity-stores.md) | ordinary Entity verbs need one elected route |
| Only the hooks the outcome needs | follow the routes below for exact package identifiers | a hook is not active because its name appears here |

## Route by what the Entity must do

| Need | Hook on or around the Entity | Continue at |
|---|---|---|
| Save, get, query, page, stream, or remove | `Save`, `Get`, `Query`, `Page`, `AllStream`, `Remove` | [choose an Entity store](entity-stores.md) |
| Use a non-string identifier | `Entity<T, TKey>` | [Data reference](../../reference/data/index.md#the-application-vocabulary) |
| Keep several runtime shapes in one searchable set | one `Entity<TRoot>` plus generated root variants | [polymorphic Entity family](../../reference/data/index.md#keep-a-polymorphic-family-in-one-set) |
| Relate a child to a parent | `[Parent(typeof(ParentType))]`, `GetParent`, `GetChildren` | [Entity relationships](relationships.md) |
| Enforce a rule around persistence | `T.Lifecycle.BeforeUpsert(...)` and the other load/upsert/remove phases | [Entity lifecycle](../../reference/data/entity-lifecycle.md) |
| Select an exceptional source, adapter, partition, or transaction | disposable `EntityContext` scopes | [context hooks](#context-hooks) |
| Isolate every operation to one customer | `using (Tenant.Use(id))` | [tenant isolation](../trust/tenant-isolation.md) |
| Cache ordinary reads | `[Cacheable(...)]` plus ordinary Entity verbs | [Entity cache](../state/cache.md) |
| Make removal recoverable | opt the Entity into soft deletion; keep ordinary `Remove()` | [recoverable deletion](recoverable-deletion.md) |
| Expose governed CRUD over HTTP | `EntityController<T>` | [Entity HTTP API](../web/entity-api.md) |
| Declare who may read or change it | `[Access(...)]` and row constraints | [access rules](../trust/access-rules.md) |
| Index and retrieve it by meaning | `[Embedding(...)]`, then `Client.Embed` + `Vector<T>.Search` | [semantic search](../ai/semantic-search.md) |
| Expose it to an outside agent | `[McpEntity(...)]` | [Entity MCP surface](../agents/entity-mcp.md) |
| Let an in-application model use it as a tool | `Agent.Create().WithEntities<T>()` | [in-application agent](../agents/in-app-agent.md) |
| Announce a business occurrence | `entity.Events.Raise<TEvent>()` | [Events and Transport](../work/events-and-transport.md) |
| Send a snapshot of current state | `entity.Transport.Send()` | [Events and Transport](../work/events-and-transport.md) |
| Own retryable or scheduled execution | `Entity<T>, IKoanJob<T>` with static `Execute` | [background Jobs](../work/background-jobs.md) |
| Own bytes | derive from `StorageEntity<T>` and add `[StorageBinding]` | [Entity-owned files](../state/entity-files.md) |
| Own an original plus reproducible derivatives | derive from `MediaEntity<T>` and declare recipes | [media derivatives](../state/media-derivatives.md) |
| Reconcile imperfect arrivals into one trusted result | derive from `CanonEntity<T>` | [Canon reconciliation](../records/canon.md) |

## Context hooks

Contexts are disposable, nestable exceptions around ordinary Entity calls. Keep the scope at the
business operation so unusual routing stays visible and restores automatically.

| Scope | Meaning | It does not mean |
|---|---|---|
| `EntityContext.Source("Published")` | use one configured named source | move the default or copy existing data |
| `EntityContext.Adapter("mongo")` | deliberately override the elected adapter | infer a package or guarantee provider parity |
| `EntityContext.Partition("north")` | route to one physical/logical partition | authorize a tenant |
| `EntityContext.Transaction("publish")` | coordinate supported work inside one Koan transaction | promise cross-provider atomicity |
| `Tenant.Use("acme")` | apply the ambient tenant boundary across participating pillars | create or authenticate the tenant |
| `EntityContext.NoCache()` / `RefreshCache()` | bypass or refresh the Entity cache for this scope | change durable truth |

For the complete context and transaction grammar, use the
[Entity capabilities guide](../../guides/entity-capabilities-howto.md#7-context-routing-partitions-sources-and-adapters).

## The constraint box

> **The constraint:** Capabilities compose at the common Entity boundary, but they do not erase one
> another's rules. Lifecycle is not an Event bus; a partition is not tenancy; MCP exposure is not
> authorization; a Job is not exactly-once execution; one Entity syntax does not promise provider
> parity. Follow every selected hook and inherit its constraint before calling the solution complete.
