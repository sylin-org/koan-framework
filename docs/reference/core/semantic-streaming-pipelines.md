# Semantic Streaming Pipelines (Moved)

This companion has merged into the Flow pillar reference as part of DX-0041. Please update bookmarks to the canonical location:

- [Flow Pillar Reference → Semantic Pipelines](../flow/index.md#semantic-pipelines)

All pipeline samples, branching patterns, and AI integration guidance now live in that document. This page remains only to preserve legacy links.
