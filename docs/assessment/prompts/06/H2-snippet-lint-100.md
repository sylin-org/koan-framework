## Session preamble

```text
You are working on the Koan Framework (.NET 10 meta-framework; repo root = the working
directory). Rules for this session — they override your defaults:

1. SCOPE: do exactly the task below. One intent per session. No drive-by fixes, no
   refactoring outside the named files, no "while I'm here".
2. EVIDENCE FIRST: before editing, read the files the task names. Never reference an API you
   have not seen in this session — the repo's older docs contain APIs that do not exist; grep
   before you trust. Any API you use in code or docs must be evidenced by a file:line you read.
3. VERIFY: run the named verification (at minimum: `dotnet build Koan.sln`). A session that
   cannot get back to green REVERTS its changes and reports — never "fix forward" into new scope.
4. OUTPUT CONTRACT: your final summary lists every file touched, and for every claim cites
   evidence ("removed X — verified zero references: grep '<pattern>' = 0 hits"). No vague claims.
5. STOP CONDITIONS — stop and report instead of choosing, if you hit ANY of: a failing test you
   did not expect; an API that does not match this recipe; a second plausible way to do the task;
   a reference to the thing you're removing from a file this recipe did not predict.
6. NO-GO ZONES (do not modify, ever, in a T1/T2 session): src/Koan.Data.Core/Model/**,
   EntityContext internals, src/Koan.Core/Hosting/** (except where a recipe names exact lines),
   RegistrySourceGenerator, capability token definitions, any adapter's query-translation code,
   any public API rename.
7. CONVENTIONS: Newtonsoft.Json is the canonical serializer (do not introduce STJ surfaces).
   Canonical entity verbs: Save / Remove / Query. Canonical module primitive: KoanModule.
   Never manually register framework services. Never add a new Add*() extension where a
   registrar exists. Commit messages: conventional commits (feat/fix/refactor/docs/test/chore).

## Task

```text
TASK: Extend scripts/validate-code-examples.ps1 coverage to ALL user-facing docs: README.md,
docs/index.md, docs/getting-started/**, docs/architecture/principles.md, samples/README.md,
.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md. Read the script first; add the paths to its file set; run it; FIX
any snippet it flags by correcting the snippet against real source (grep the APIs — never
adjust code to match a doc). Wire the expanded scope into green-ratchet.ps1 and the B2 PR gate.
DONE WHEN: the lint passes on the full set and is part of the ratchet.
```
