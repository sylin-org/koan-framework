# Prompt Stash Progress Ledger

One-stop tracking for the assessment's implementation prompts. Each row maps to a
self-contained card file under [`06/`](06/) (tactical) or [`07/`](07/) (strategic).
Canonical sources: [`../06-prompt-stash.md`](../06-prompt-stash.md) and
[`../07-strategic-prompt-stash.md`](../07-strategic-prompt-stash.md).

**Agents**: open your card file, paste it into a fresh session, and update your row here —
status `in-progress` when you start, `done` / `blocked` / `obsolete` (with a one-line note)
when you finish. Link commits by short SHA. If repo reality contradicts the card, record it
in the **Divergence log** at the bottom.

**Tier** (load-bearing — do not feed frontier cards to small models):
`T1` small model, autonomous · `T2` small model, recipe-driven · `T3` frontier model only.

**Status**: `pending` · `in-progress` · `done` · `blocked` · `obsolete`.

## Run order (it's a gated DAG, not a strict sequence)

```text
FIRST:  B1 (sln truth) · F1 (fail-loud boot — improves every later session's error visibility)
THEN:   A1 A2 A3 · C0 · all cut/park cards (C*) · most E* · D* · G* — any order, B1 first for cuts
LATE:   H-series (docs/DX) after A2 lands · B2/B3 (CI/release) after B1
07:     entire strategic ladder gated on B1 + F1 + A2 first; then P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5,
        with hard gates noted per row (P4.1 ← Facet 3; P4.2 ← 06 S3).
```

## 06 — Tactical (truth restoration, cuts, migrations, DX)

Preamble for these cards: the `[PREAMBLE]` block in `../06-prompt-stash.md`.

> **REORG (2026-06-14).** The cut/park cards were reclassified by
> [08-agyo-reorganization.md](../08-agyo-reorganization.md) (+ agyo-tools `AGYO-0001`) into a
> three-way disposition. **→ agyo (migrate):** C2 (done — `Sylin.Agyo.WebSockets`), C4, C7, C9,
> C10, C13, C17. **→ split:** C5 (delete Recipe.Abstractions / migrate Observability bundle), C8
> (delete ServiceMesh / migrate Translation). **→ confirmed delete:** C1, C3, C6, C11, C14, C19.
> The Status/Notes columns below remain the **Koan-side** truth (cut/reverted/blocked as executed);
> **agyo-side migration status is tracked in agyo-tools `docs/SURFACES.md`**, not duplicated here.
> Consumer-facing migrations (C5/C7/C9/C17) proceed under transition safety. See the Divergence log.

| ID | Tier | Deps | Status | Date | Agent/model | Commits | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | T2 | — (first) | done | 2026-06-13 | opus-4.8 | (uncommitted) | sln truth — added 25 buildable test projects (168→195 incl. 2 transitive prod refs); EXCLUDED 13 broken/husk projects beyond the card's 5 (see Divergence log) — build green, `--list-tests` enumerates 2922 tests / 71 assemblies |
| B2 | T2 | B1 | pending | | | | CI PR gate |
| B3 | T3 | B1, B2 | pending | | | | NBGV-native release; nuspec metadata fix |
| A1 | T1 | — | done | 2026-06-13 | opus-4.8 | c3a13de8 | 30 ADRs marked; docs-lint 0 errors. Drift: FLOW banner reworded truthfully (Flow→Canon mid-flight, not removed); DATA-0019 skipped (card mislabels Outbox as Cqrs; no CQRS ADR exists) |
| A2 | T2 | — | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 8bcc0bb6 | ghost APIs (Flow/.Embed/koan-CLI/Describe(BootReport)) + 0.6.3 pins removed across 6 docs; docs-lint clean. Ran parallel w/ H5+H7 |
| A3 | T1 | — | done | 2026-06-13 | opus-4.8 | ad13b65c | 11 tracked litter + 103 *.lscache (card said ~9) + stale Cache/Unit; build green; ran parallel w/ A1; fixed 1 cross-card link (DEC-0053) |
| C0 | T1 | — | pending | | | | wave 0: debris/tombstone directories |
| C1 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 825e6fd0 | cut Koan.Data.Cqrs + Mongo outbox (zero consumers → JOBS-0005); DATA-0019 superseded; build + bootstrap 24/24 green; ran on dev alongside user's Mcp work |
| C2 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-13 | opus-4.8 | ffef0899 | cut Koan.WebSockets (197→195); 0 src consumers, absent from ledgers/nuspec; build + bootstrap integration 17/17 green. **→ REORG: migrated to agyo** (Sylin.Agyo.WebSockets.0.1.2, build+pack green) — the proven reference pattern for the other migrations |
| C3 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-13 | opus-4.8 | 035dc891 | cut Koan.Web.Json.Strict (195→193); STJ island, 0 consumers, absent from ledgers/nuspec; build + bootstrap integration 17/17 green |
| C4 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 5c2d7498 | attic-tagged + cut GraphQl connector (archived S4 sole consumer; HotChocolate CVE treadmill); WEB-0041/0042 superseded; tag attic/koan-web-graphql; not consumed; build green |
| C5 | T2 | B1 | reverted | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 7780672f → 35318300 | **REVERTED** — Koan.Recipe.Observability is consumed by an external downstream repo (PackageReference + packed from source); the cut would break it. Restored the Recipe pillar + undid the Koan.Web fold. The only externally-broken cut. |
| C6 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 54576324 | cut Inbox-Redis connector (dead client API, only archived consumer); MESS-0025/0026 already retired; build green, sln 288→284 |
| C7 | T2 | B1 | blocked | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | (external-consumer gate) | **BLOCKED — Koan.Secrets.Core is consumed by an external downstream repo** (PackageReference + packed). Do not park Secrets.Core. Abstractions/Vault may be separable, but hold the whole card pending the consumer's call. |
| C8 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | f7d8a499 | cut ServiceMesh + .Abstractions + Translation (4 projects) + excised Web.Admin defensive surface; S8 atticked; not consumed downstream; build green, zero refs |
| C9 | T2 | B1 | obsolete | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | (aborted, no change) | **DO NOT PARK** — Koan.Tagging has ACTIVE external consumers (a downstream repo). The card's "zero consumers" is IN-REPO only; external consumers are invisible to the precheck grep. Aborted before any file moved; Koan.Tagging intact in src/ + sln. |
| C10 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | d5c03ae0 | parked Koan.Rag + Abstractions to attic (zero consumers, recoverable); deleted Rag bootstrap spec (F1 specs intact); not consumed downstream; build green |
| C11 | T2 | B1 | pending | | | | cut Koan.AI dead pipeline surface (not the project) |
| C13 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 3f3c1f68 | cut PGVector (didn't compile) + orphan test + dead IVectorFilterTranslator/VectorEmbeddingAttribute; unwound B1's transitive sln-add; tagged attic/pgvector; not consumed; build green, sln 279→277 |
| C14 | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 99c1ef70 | removed legacy ResilientStorageDecorator + Resilient flag (kept StorageFallbackMode + default/Replicated path untouched); external audit clean (downstream uses Koan.Storage, not Resilient); build green. Done directly by orchestrator (agent rate-limited) |
| C17 | T2 | B1 | blocked | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | (external-consumer gate) | **BLOCKED — Koan.Scheduling is consumed by an external downstream repo** (PackageReference + packed). The migrate-to-Jobs cut would break the consumer. Hold pending the consumer migrating off IScheduledTask (or keep Scheduling). |
| C19 | T2 | B1 | pending | | | | execute MEDIA-0008's overdue deletion |
| C20a | T2 | B1 | pending | | | | merge Swagger connector into Koan.Web.OpenApi |
| C20b | T2 | B1 | done | 2026-06-14 | opus-4.8 | 31898d9e | merged Koan.Admin (dead console-UI split, EnableConsoleUi never implemented) into Koan.Web.Admin (24 files, namespaces folded); not consumed downstream; build green, sln 182→181 |

## Cards discovered during pilot execution

New cards surfaced while running other cards (not in the original 06/07 stash). Same columns.

| ID | Tier | Deps | Status | Date | Agent/model | Commits | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| X-KoanContext | T3 | — | pending | | | | **park / re-home** `src/Services/code-intelligence/Koan.Service.KoanContext` out of the framework repo. 14.8k LOC, net10.0, the repo's largest project, **never in Koan.sln**, zero in-repo consumers; breaks are its own mid-refactor debris (`IndexProject`→`IndexProjectAsync` delegate rename), not framework drift. Canon already recommends eviction (`pillar-periphery-services.json:298`, Zen Garden precedent). Triaged 2026-06-13. Move it + `tests/Suites/Context/**`; keep its docs/ADRs as the trail. **Reorg (2026-06-14):** agyo-tools is now a candidate re-home — but agyo hosts opt-in helper **libraries** (`Sylin.Agyo.*` packages apps reference), and KoanContext is a code-intelligence **service/tool**, not a library. Weigh agyo vs Zen Garden (the named precedent) vs its own repo before moving; it is not a clean `Sylin.Agyo.*` fit. |
| X-FluentAssertions | T2 | — | pending | | | | finish the FluentAssertions v6→v7 migration left behind on excluded test projects: `S16.PantryPal.Tests` (`BeGreaterOrEqualTo`→`BeGreaterThanOrEqualTo`, `HaveCountGreaterOrEqualTo`→`HaveCountGreaterThanOrEqualTo`, + a CS1997 async `DisposeAsync`); audit the other excluded husks for the same rot; re-add to sln once green. |
| X-snippet-lint-fix | T2 | — | pending | | | | fix `scripts/validate-code-examples.ps1` — it crashes at line 219 (PowerShell SwitchParameter bug) in ALL modes, reproduced on untouched files, so it validates nothing. **Blocks H2** (snippet lint to 100%) and degrades the docs gate to link-check only. |
| X-semantic-pipelines-retire | T2 | — | pending | | | | retire/rewrite `docs/guides/semantic-pipelines.md` — it is wholesale deleted-Flow-pillar prose. A2 did the named ghost fixes + flipped `status: draft`, but the guide needs a real rewrite against the current pipeline API or archival. |

## Divergence log

When a pre-flight fails or repo reality contradicts a card, record it here:
date · prompt ID · what was found · what was done instead.

| Date | ID | Finding | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-13 | B1 | The card named only 5 husks to exclude. In reality 38 test projects were missing from the sln, and **13 more break the build** beyond the card's list: (a) 3 net8.0 husks referencing nonexistent `Koan.TestPipeline`/`Koan.*` NuGet packages — `Koan.Storage.Core.Tests`, `Koan.Web.Admin.Tests`; (b) 2 net8.0 sample-test husks that fail restore (`Koan.Samples.DocMind.Tests` refs a *missing* `samples/S13.DocMind/API/...csproj`; `Koan.Samples.PantryPal.Tests` is net8.0 vs net10.0 `Koan.Testing`); (c) 3 MCP/PantryPal projects fail NU1903 (transitive MessagePack 2.5.192 CVE — the 7e8a44f0 pin only covers projects that ProjectReference `Koan.Orchestration.Aspire`, which these don't): `Koan.Mcp.TestHost`, `Koan.Samples.McpCodeMode.Tests`, `S16.PantryPal.Tests`; (d) 4 projects fail **compilation** against current APIs — `Koan.Web.Sort.Tests` (CS7022 dup entrypoint), `Koan.Storage.Connector.Local.Tests` (stale `StorageProfile`/`StorageOptions`/caps), `S7.Meridian.Tests` (stale `IEmbeddingCache`/`CachedEmbedding`/`IDocumentStorage.Delete`), and a **production** project `src/Services/code-intelligence/Koan.Service.KoanContext` (does not compile; was dragged in transitively by `Koan.Tests.Context.Unit`). | Added the 25 buildable live test projects (+2 transitive prod refs `Koan.Cache.Analyzers`, `Koan.Data.Connector.PGVector`). Per STOP condition, did NOT fix-forward any broken project; excluded all 13 breakers (and orphaned transitive pull-ins `samples/S7.Meridian`, `Koan.Service.KoanContext`). Build green; `--list-tests` exit 0. These 13 are husk/rot candidates for the C-series cut cards — they fell out of the sln precisely because they don't build. |
| 2026-06-13 | B1·CVE | (B1 follow-up, per architect decision) `StreamJsonRpc 2.22.23 → MessagePack 2.5.192` is a **second** CVE-2026-48109 root not covered by `7e8a44f0`'s Aspire-only pin: 12 NU1903 warnings fleet-wide + 3 unbuildable MCP test projects. | Pinned MessagePack 2.5.301 in `Koan.Mcp` (the sole direct StreamJsonRpc referencer) → NU1903 = 0; recovered `Koan.Mcp.TestHost` + `Koan.Samples.McpCodeMode.Tests` into the sln (195→197). Commits `b8530a30`, `28bb32ba`. Also fixed the malformed XML comment that broke `dev`'s build (`dcc1477c`). |
| 2026-06-13 | S16.PantryPal.Tests | The CVE pin recovered 2 of B1's 3 MCP breakers, but this one has rot **beyond** the CVE: stale FluentAssertions v6 API + a CS1997 async `DisposeAsync` bug. | Left excluded from the sln; logged as card **X-FluentAssertions**. Not fix-forwarded — separate concern from the CVE. |
| 2026-06-13 | A1 | Card prescribes the banner "Flow pillar removed from the codebase" and names "DATA-0019 (Cqrs)". Reality: Flow is **mid-migration to Canon** (`Koan.Canon.Domain`/`.Web` still in the sln; `Koan.Flow.Core`/`Koan.Canon.Core` dirs exist) — not removed; and `DATA-0019` is the **Outbox** ADR, there is **no CQRS ADR**, while `src/Koan.Data.Cqrs` still exists. | FLOW banners reworded to the truthful "superseded by the Koan.Canon rebuild"; DATA-0019 skipped (both act-conditions unmet). Upstream gap flagged: the CQRS decision has no ADR. |
| 2026-06-13 | A3 | Card estimated "~9" `*.csproj.lscache`; actual **103** (one per project). Deleting `ZERO-CONFIG-ANALYSIS.md` orphaned an inbound link at `docs/decisions/DEC-0053:339` — a **cross-card artifact** (A3 deletes; the link lives in A1's lane). | Deleted all 103 (gitignored). Orchestrator repaired the DEC-0053 link during integration (folded into A3 commit `ad13b65c`). Confirms: concurrent cards can create artifacts neither owns — the integrator resolves them. |
| 2026-06-14 | F1 | First code-adding card under the strengthened test-adequacy gate. The implementation was faithful and its 2 initial ARCH-0079 specs were mutation-proof — but the gate's **coverage critic** found the **manifest-invoker fail-loud path** (the one whose failure "can silently no-op the ENTIRE framework") and the **MODULES-FAILED render** were UNTESTED. A careful agent still missed the most dangerous path. | Remediated: +5 specs (manifest fail-fast/lenient, render +/-, KoanBootException field/message, clean-boot guard) + a minimal null-by-default internal test seam (the source-gen loader swallows everything, so the branch is otherwise unreachable). Orchestrator **independently mutation-checked** every new spec (revert→fail, restore→pass). F1 passes only AFTER remediation. Lesson: comprehensive integration tests are not automatic — the coverage-critic + mutation-check gate is what makes "wrote tests" mean "tested the dangerous paths". |
| 2026-06-14 | wave-2 docs (A2/H5/H7, parallel) | (a) `scripts/validate-code-examples.ps1` is **broken** (SwitchParameter crash, line 219) in all modes — snippet-lint validates nothing. (b) `set` drifted → folded into `partition` (DATA-0077); `BootReport` is no longer a type (rendered provenance). (c) A2's heading rename broke an inbound deep link from out-of-lane `docs/examples/entity-pattern-recipes.md:40` (A2 left a backward-compat anchor shim). (d) `semantic-pipelines.md` is wholesale deleted-Flow prose. | 3 cards ran in parallel cleanly (disjoint lanes); glossary anchors `set`→partition + BootReport→renderer; orchestrator fixed the pre-existing `index.md → reference/index.md` broken link at integration. New cards filed: X-snippet-lint-fix (blocks H2), X-semantic-pipelines-retire. `DataSetContext.With(set)` ghost in comparison.md deferred. |
| 2026-06-14 | C9 + ALL cut cards | **SYSTEMIC blind spot, caught by the operator.** Cut/park prechecks grep only IN-REPO consumers (src/samples/tests/sln), but Koan ships as NuGet packages whose real consumers live in OTHER repos — invisible to that grep. C9's target Koan.Tagging is actively consumed by a downstream repo, so it must NOT be cut/parked. The same in-repo-only precheck passed the 5 already-merged cuts (C1 Cqrs, C2 WebSockets, C3 Json.Strict, C5 Recipe, C6 Inbox-Redis). | C9 aborted (no change; Koan.Tagging intact). **Cut batch HALTED** (C14 not run) pending an external-consumer audit of the 5 merged cuts — any externally-consumed package may need reverting. **New rule: every cut/park precheck must include an external-consumer check (downstream repos / NuGet), not just in-repo grep.** |
| 2026-06-14 | external-consumer audit — RESOLVED | Audited the 5 merged cuts against the downstream consumer repo + Koan samples (consumer repo path kept private per persona separation). Only **Koan.Recipe.Observability (C5)** was actually consumed (PackageReference + packed from source) → reverted (`35318300`). **Koan.Tagging** (C9 target) consumed → not cut. **C1 Cqrs / C2 WebSockets / C6 Inbox-Redis** = zero downstream refs → stay cut. **C3 Web.Json.Strict** = only a doc mention → stays cut (re-add if it was planned). | Net: 1 of 6 reverted; build green. Going-forward gate: every cut/park is preceded by an external-consumer grep of the downstream repo + Koan samples before removal. |
| 2026-06-14 | C-series reorg → agyo-tools | The cut-or-keep binary kept losing capability the external-consumer gate flagged (C5/C7/C9/C17 all "cuts" that turned out consumed). An independent 11-capability re-eval ([08-agyo-reorganization.md](../08-agyo-reorganization.md)) found **0 core-Koan, 9 preservable** → the user founded **agyo-tools** ("PowerToys for Koan"; sibling repo depending on `Sylin.Koan.*` public packages, never the reverse — STACK-0001). | Scaffolded agyo to Koan's repo canon (`AGYO-0001`) + a local Koan package feed; migrated **WebSockets (C2)** end-to-end (`Sylin.Agyo.WebSockets.0.1.2`, build+pack green, layering clean, pushed to agyo `origin/dev`); readjusted the 06 cut cards + added a MIGRATE-TEMPLATE + the migrate-to-agyo ACCEPTANCE addendum. Remaining migrations (C4/C5/C7/C8/C9/C10/C13/C17) tracked in agyo `docs/SURFACES.md`. |

When a card surfaces a post-merge action that lives outside the repo (a prod migration, a CI
secret, a manual deploy step), append a `### <ID> operator gate` subsection here describing it,
so the operator has a single place to find pending out-of-band work. None yet.
