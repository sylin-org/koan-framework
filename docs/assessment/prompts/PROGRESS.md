# Prompt Stash Progress Ledger

One-stop tracking for the assessment's implementation prompts. Each row maps to a
self-contained card file under [`06/`](06/) (tactical) or [`07/`](07/) (strategic).
Canonical sources: [`../06-prompt-stash.md`](../06-prompt-stash.md) and
[`../07-strategic-prompt-stash.md`](../07-strategic-prompt-stash.md).

**Agents**: open your card file, paste it into a fresh session, and update your row here —
status `in-progress` when you start, `done` / `blocked` / `obsolete` (with a one-line note)
when you finish. Link commits by short SHA. If repo reality contradicts the card, record it
in the **Divergence log** at the bottom.

**Tier** (load-bearing — do not feed frontier cards to small models):
`T1` small model, autonomous · `T2` small model, recipe-driven · `T3` frontier model only.

**Status**: `pending` · `in-progress` · `done` · `blocked` · `obsolete`.

## Run order (it's a gated DAG, not a strict sequence)

```text
FIRST:  B1 (sln truth) · F1 (fail-loud boot — improves every later session's error visibility)
THEN:   A1 A2 A3 · C0 · all cut/park cards (C*) · most E* · D* · G* — any order, B1 first for cuts
LATE:   H-series (docs/DX) after A2 lands · B2/B3 (CI/release) after B1
07:     entire strategic ladder gated on B1 + F1 + A2 first; then P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5,
        with hard gates noted per row (P4.1 ← Facet 3; P4.2 ← 06 S3).
```

## 06 — Tactical (truth restoration, cuts, migrations, DX)

## Cards discovered during pilot execution

New cards surfaced while running other cards (not in the original 06/07 stash). Same columns.

| ID | Tier | Deps | Status | Date | Agent/model | Commits | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| X-KoanContext | T3 | — | pending | | | | **park / re-home** `src/Services/code-intelligence/Koan.Service.KoanContext` out of the framework repo. 14.8k LOC, net10.0, the repo's largest project, **never in Koan.sln**, zero in-repo consumers; breaks are its own mid-refactor debris (`IndexProject`→`IndexProjectAsync` delegate rename), not framework drift. Canon already recommends eviction (`pillar-periphery-services.json:298`, Zen Garden precedent). Triaged 2026-06-13. Move it + `tests/Suites/Context/**`; keep its docs/ADRs as the trail. |
| X-FluentAssertions | T2 | — | pending | | | | finish the FluentAssertions v6→v7 migration left behind on excluded test projects: `S16.PantryPal.Tests` (`BeGreaterOrEqualTo`→`BeGreaterThanOrEqualTo`, `HaveCountGreaterOrEqualTo`→`HaveCountGreaterThanOrEqualTo`, + a CS1997 async `DisposeAsync`); audit the other excluded husks for the same rot; re-add to sln once green. |

## Divergence log

When a pre-flight fails or repo reality contradicts a card, record it here:
date · prompt ID · what was found · what was done instead.

| Date | ID | Finding | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-13 | B1 | The card named only 5 husks to exclude. In reality 38 test projects were missing from the sln, and **13 more break the build** beyond the card's list: (a) 3 net8.0 husks referencing nonexistent `Koan.TestPipeline`/`Koan.*` NuGet packages — `Koan.Storage.Core.Tests`, `Koan.Web.Admin.Tests`; (b) 2 net8.0 sample-test husks that fail restore (`Koan.Samples.DocMind.Tests` refs a *missing* `samples/S13.DocMind/API/...csproj`; `Koan.Samples.PantryPal.Tests` is net8.0 vs net10.0 `Koan.Testing`); (c) 3 MCP/PantryPal projects fail NU1903 (transitive MessagePack 2.5.192 CVE — the 7e8a44f0 pin only covers projects that ProjectReference `Koan.Orchestration.Aspire`, which these don't): `Koan.Mcp.TestHost`, `Koan.Samples.McpCodeMode.Tests`, `S16.PantryPal.Tests`; (d) 4 projects fail **compilation** against current APIs — `Koan.Web.Sort.Tests` (CS7022 dup entrypoint), `Koan.Storage.Connector.Local.Tests` (stale `StorageProfile`/`StorageOptions`/caps), `S7.Meridian.Tests` (stale `IEmbeddingCache`/`CachedEmbedding`/`IDocumentStorage.Delete`), and a **production** project `src/Services/code-intelligence/Koan.Service.KoanContext` (does not compile; was dragged in transitively by `Koan.Tests.Context.Unit`). | Added the 25 buildable live test projects (+2 transitive prod refs `Koan.Cache.Analyzers`, `Koan.Data.Connector.PGVector`). Per STOP condition, did NOT fix-forward any broken project; excluded all 13 breakers (and orphaned transitive pull-ins `samples/S7.Meridian`, `Koan.Service.KoanContext`). Build green; `--list-tests` exit 0. These 13 are husk/rot candidates for the C-series cut cards — they fell out of the sln precisely because they don't build. |
| 2026-06-13 | B1·CVE | (B1 follow-up, per architect decision) `StreamJsonRpc 2.22.23 → MessagePack 2.5.192` is a **second** CVE-2026-48109 root not covered by `7e8a44f0`'s Aspire-only pin: 12 NU1903 warnings fleet-wide + 3 unbuildable MCP test projects. | Pinned MessagePack 2.5.301 in `Koan.Mcp` (the sole direct StreamJsonRpc referencer) → NU1903 = 0; recovered `Koan.Mcp.TestHost` + `Koan.Samples.McpCodeMode.Tests` into the sln (195→197). Commits `b8530a30`, `28bb32ba`. Also fixed the malformed XML comment that broke `dev`'s build (`dcc1477c`). |
| 2026-06-13 | S16.PantryPal.Tests | The CVE pin recovered 2 of B1's 3 MCP breakers, but this one has rot **beyond** the CVE: stale FluentAssertions v6 API + a CS1997 async `DisposeAsync` bug. | Left excluded from the sln; logged as card **X-FluentAssertions**. Not fix-forwarded — separate concern from the CVE. |
| 2026-06-13 | A1 | Card prescribes the banner "Flow pillar removed from the codebase" and names "DATA-0019 (Cqrs)". Reality: Flow is **mid-migration to Canon** (`Koan.Canon.Domain`/`.Web` still in the sln; `Koan.Flow.Core`/`Koan.Canon.Core` dirs exist) — not removed; and `DATA-0019` is the **Outbox** ADR, there is **no CQRS ADR**, while `src/Koan.Data.Cqrs` still exists. | FLOW banners reworded to the truthful "superseded by the Koan.Canon rebuild"; DATA-0019 skipped (both act-conditions unmet). Upstream gap flagged: the CQRS decision has no ADR. |
| 2026-06-13 | A3 | Card estimated "~9" `*.csproj.lscache`; actual **103** (one per project). Deleting `ZERO-CONFIG-ANALYSIS.md` orphaned an inbound link at `docs/decisions/DEC-0053:339` — a **cross-card artifact** (A3 deletes; the link lives in A1's lane). | Deleted all 103 (gitignored). Orchestrator repaired the DEC-0053 link during integration (folded into A3 commit `ad13b65c`). Confirms: concurrent cards can create artifacts neither owns — the integrator resolves them. |
| 2026-06-14 | F1 | First code-adding card under the strengthened test-adequacy gate. The implementation was faithful and its 2 initial ARCH-0079 specs were mutation-proof — but the gate's **coverage critic** found the **manifest-invoker fail-loud path** (the one whose failure "can silently no-op the ENTIRE framework") and the **MODULES-FAILED render** were UNTESTED. A careful agent still missed the most dangerous path. | Remediated: +5 specs (manifest fail-fast/lenient, render +/-, KoanBootException field/message, clean-boot guard) + a minimal null-by-default internal test seam (the source-gen loader swallows everything, so the branch is otherwise unreachable). Orchestrator **independently mutation-checked** every new spec (revert→fail, restore→pass). F1 passes only AFTER remediation. Lesson: comprehensive integration tests are not automatic — the coverage-critic + mutation-check gate is what makes "wrote tests" mean "tested the dangerous paths". |

## Operator gates

When a card surfaces a post-merge action that lives outside the repo (a prod migration, a CI
secret, a manual deploy step), append a `### <ID> operator gate` subsection here describing it,
so the operator has a single place to find pending out-of-band work. None yet.
