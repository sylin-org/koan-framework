# Entity Pattern Scaling (Moved)

This catalog has merged into the unified [Entity Pattern Recipe Catalog](entity-pattern-recipes.md) as part of the DX-0041 consolidation. Update bookmarks to that document for:

- Stage-by-stage CRUD, messaging, and AI integration recipes.
- Cross-pillar checklists linking Data, Web, Flow, and AI guidance.
- Advanced patterns for soft deletes, auditing, and projection hubs.

The legacy file remains solely to preserve inbound links.
