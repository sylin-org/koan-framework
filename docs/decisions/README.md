# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder is the single source of truth for Koan ADRs.

- Start with `index.md` for the contract, submission workflow, and high-signal highlights.
- Use `toc.yml` to wire the DocFX navigation (update it whenever you add a new ADR).
- Drafts should clone `AAAA-0000-template.md` and retain the `PREFIX-####-short-title.md` naming.
