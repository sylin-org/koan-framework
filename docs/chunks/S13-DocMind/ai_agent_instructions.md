### Cross-Chunk Consistency Validation

**Entity Consistency:**
- Entity definitions in Chunk 2 must match usage in Chunks 3, 4, 6
- Provider assignments must align across all technical chunks
- Relationship patterns must be consistent in all implementations

**Flow Integration:**
- Flow commands in Chunk 3 must align with API triggers in Chunk 4
- Event sourcing patterns must match entity lifecycle in Chunk 2
- Background processing must align with deployment specs in Chunk 7

**Framework Compliance:**
- All specifications must follow Koan Framework principles
- Auto-registration patterns must be consistent across all components
- Provider transparency must be maintained in all data access patterns

## Error Handling and Escalation

### Common Processing Issues

**Context Window Limitations:**
- Use sub-chunk processing for Chunks 4, 6, 7
- Prioritize key concept extraction over implementation details
- Maintain cross-references between sub-chunks

**Specification Conflicts:**
- Escalate to coordination checkpoints
- Document conflicts in `conflicts.md` for resolution
- Use Chunk 8 migration patterns as conflict resolution guide

**Framework Compliance Violations:**
- Consult Koan Framework specialist for authoritative resolution
- Document deviations with explicit justification
- Update specifications to maintain framework alignment

### Escalation Matrix

**Level 1 - Agent Self-Resolution:**
- Minor specification gaps or implementation details
- Cross-reference with Chunk 8 migration patterns
- Document assumptions and continue processing

**Level 2 - Coordination Checkpoint:**
- Conflicts between chunks requiring multi-agent resolution
- Major architectural decisions affecting multiple domains
- Integration patterns requiring specialist consensus

**Level 3 - Framework Authority:**
- Fundamental conflicts with Koan Framework principles
- Security or compliance specification gaps
- Performance requirement conflicts with framework capabilities
