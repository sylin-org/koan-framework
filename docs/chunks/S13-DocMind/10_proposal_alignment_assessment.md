# Proposal Alignment Assessment (Registrar Update)

## Executive Summary
- ‚úÖ The S13.DocMind sample now boots with the packaged `DocMindRegistrar`; no custom `AddDocMind()` extension remains in scope.
- üìå Program.cs guidance has been reduced to a registrar-centric pattern, matching the intent of the original proposal's ‚Äúsingle-call startup‚Äù narrative.

## Alignment Checklist
- [x] Infrastructure documentation (Chunk 05) references `AddKoan<DocMindRegistrar>()` and highlights MCP defaults.
- [x] Migration guidance (Chunk 08) treats the registrar as pre-built and focuses on verification tasks.
- [x] DX collateral (README, agent instructions, orchestration script) emphasize registrar validation instead of authoring new DI code.
- [x] Gap analysis (Chunk 09) reflects the updated bootstrap workflow and downstream tasks.

## Follow-Up Questions
1. Do we need a quickstart snippet demonstrating how to override `DocMindRegistrar` defaults for advanced scenarios?
2. Should the proposal mention the registrar explicitly in the capability matrix for consistency with other samples?
3. Are there telemetry requirements that should be codified in the registrar documentation?

## Recommendation
Proceed with publishing the updated collateral. Call out the registrar-first bootstrap in release notes and communicate the retirement of the `AddDocMind()` guidance to downstream integrators.
