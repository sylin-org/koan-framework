# **S13.DocMind: AI-Native Document Intelligence Platform**

## **Executive Summary**

**S13.DocMind** is a comprehensive guided sample that showcases how the Koan Framework stitches together data and AI capabilities to build an AI-native document intelligence experience with **full GDoc feature parity** and **complete MCP orchestration**. This enhanced version demonstrates rich structured document analysis, complete visual content understanding, intelligent auto-classification capabilities, and seamless AI agent integration through the Model Context Protocol. Rather than prescribing an enterprise migration, it walks readers through advanced architectural patterns and building blocks they can reuse when crafting sophisticated document intelligence solutions.

This sample assumes lightweight evaluation datasets (dozens of documents, individual files ≤10 MB) and is optimized for interactive walkthroughs, scripted demos, and workshop labs. Larger workloads, multi-team governance, and production-grade SLAs are called out as optional explorations for teams who want to push the framework further.

The enhanced sample provides sophisticated document intelligence features including entity extraction, diagram understanding, semantic type matching, and document chunking for large files. It demonstrates advanced Koan Framework patterns for multi-provider data strategies, AI integration, auto-generated APIs, and **process-complete MCP integration** that enables full AI agent orchestration while maintaining the framework's core principle of "Reference = Intent."

## **Problem Domain Analysis**

### **Enhanced Solution Capabilities (GDoc Feature Parity)**
The enhanced S13-DocMind solution now provides comprehensive document intelligence features:

- **Structured Resource Access**: Document content, analysis results, and templates accessible via MCP resources
- **Intelligent Prompt Templates**: Context-aware prompts for document analysis, classification, and interpretation
- **Multi-Transport Support**: STDIO and HTTP+SSE transports for different integration scenarios

### **Architectural Challenges Identified**
1. **Manual Infrastructure**: 60+ lines of DI registration in `Program.cs`
2. **Provider Lock-in**: MongoDB-specific implementation patterns
3. **Complex Orchestration**: Manual service coordination and error handling (addressed through lightweight hosted services)
4. **Limited Scalability**: Single-provider architecture constrains growth
5. **AI Integration Complexity**: Custom HTTP clients and response parsing
6. **Development Friction**: Significant boilerplate for CRUD operations

### **Refactoring Vision**
- **Bedrock-first**: Stabilize the data foundation around clearly named models—`SourceDocument`, `DocumentTemplate`, `DocumentChunk`, `DocumentInsight`, and `SemanticTypeProfile`—so downstream services read as intent instead of plumbing.
- **Processing lanes with guardrails**: Replace ad-hoc workflow logic with a queue-backed `DocumentAnalysisPipeline` hosted service that orchestrates ingestion, enrichment, semantic search, and insights while publishing status projections through Koan observability primitives.
- **Composable AI services**: Centralize prompting, extraction, and embedding in focused collaborators (`TextExtractionService`, `InsightSynthesisService`, `TemplateSuggestionService`) that consume Koan AI abstractions directly and can be swapped for provider-specific implementations without touching controllers.
- **UI-aligned APIs**: Shape controllers around scenario-first endpoints (`DocumentsController`, `TemplatesController`, `InsightsController`, `ModelsController`) that pair naturally with the Angular client, limit chatty round-trips, and expose MCP tools with shared contracts.
- **Minimal-yet-extensible stack**: Keep Docker Compose as the happy path—API + MongoDB + Weaviate + Ollama—while providing clear switches for optional GPU, vector, or storage providers so workshops stay approachable.

### **Opportunities to Streamline Developer Experience**
- **Declarative service registration** via an `S13DocMindRegistrar` that auto-discovers pipeline services, storage providers, and hosted workers, shrinking `Program.cs` to intent-level configuration.
- **Self-describing diagnostics** using Koan boot reports plus per-stage processing metrics persisted on `DocumentProcessingEvent` to accelerate troubleshooting during labs.
- **Scenario-driven naming** throughout the solution (e.g., `DocumentIntakeController.UploadSourceDocument`) to clarify intent for newcomers and align with documentation.
- **Template-driven prompts** stored on the `SemanticTypeProfile` entity so AI agents, APIs, and MCP clients pull from a single source of truth.
- **Front-end ready contracts** that embed chunk summaries, insight collections, and suggestion payloads alongside status metadata to reduce bespoke mapping inside the Angular workspace.
