# Resume application evolution

Read the [charter](README.md) and [live ledger](PROGRESS.md), then
[published-package evidence](evidence/AE-01a.md). The ledger is authoritative if this handoff ages.

## Next implementation session

1. Check the working tree and owners, then claim [AE-02](work-items/02-application-evolution.md).
   AE-01 and AE-01a are complete; do not rebuild their applications elsewhere or rerun discovery.
2. Use `samples/applications/SharedApprovals/ApprovalDesk` and `ExpenseDesk`, with their shared
   `Foundation`. Read the workspace README and AGENTS.md. A03 owns the first app and recording;
   its published Koan dependency prerequisite is now proved, while the remaining scenes and recording
   retain A03's existing criteria.
3. Use the normal `dotnet run` commands and `verify.ps1` directly. The foundation references
   published App 1.0.23, SQLite connector 1.0.30, and MCP 1.0.29, bringing Core 1.0.34 transitively.
   There is no local Core preparation step. Never publish from the workstation.
4. Commit AE-02 task contracts before attempts: semantic search, durable background work, and
   shared-policy evolution, with explicit preserved contracts and measurements. Reuse the existing
   evaluation runner where applicable; the AE-01 fixture is not an independent agent campaign.
5. Follow [the exploration workflow](../../../.codex/skills/explore/SKILL.md) for new production
   edits. AE-03 must add real identity and tenancy boundaries; the current HTTP/MCP proof establishes
   business policy only. Its generated Code Mode SDK needs separate assessment before being advertised.

Reuse evaluation infrastructure where it fits; its existing run protocols and results retain
their provenance. The internal decision point precedes independent pilots. Public claims and
outreach follow the charter's existing boundaries.
