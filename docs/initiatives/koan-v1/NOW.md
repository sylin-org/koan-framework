# Koan V1 Reorganization Current Handoff

Replace this file at every handoff. It is a restart point, not a diary.

## Active work

- Work item: [R04 — Harden the framework foundation](work-items/R04-foundation-hardening.md)
- State: `in-progress`
- Active child: [R04-02 — Establish host-scoped runtime ownership](work-items/r04/R04-02-host-scoped-runtime.md)
- Objective: make repeated hosts and tests unable to inherit disposed providers, registrations, or
  other host-owned runtime state.
- Foundation: R01 passed through [ARCH-0105](../../decisions/ARCH-0105-product-constitution.md) and the
  canonical [product constitution](../../architecture/product-constitution.md).
- Current state: R02 and R03 passed. All 13 surfaces are classified in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md); [ARCH-0106](../../decisions/ARCH-0106-entity-semantics-contract.md)
  and the canonical [Entity Semantics Contract](../../architecture/entity-semantics-contract.md)
  now bound implementation choices. The dependency-ordered [`R04-BACKLOG.md`](R04-BACKLOG.md) is
  established, R04-01 passed, and no capability maturity label changed.

## Next safe actions

1. Run the `explore` skill for R04-02 before production edits.
2. Reproduce the known Data/AI disposed-provider failure with a bounded command and explicit test count.
3. Inventory only host-owned static caches/registries on that path; distinguish immutable process facts
   from service-provider or registration state.
4. Identify the smallest host-lifetime seam and the closest existing repeatable-host pattern.
5. Stop at the skill's implementation checkpoint with exact files, compatibility risk, and proof plan.

## Expected working tree

R04-01 should be committed as one safety repair plus its new focused suite and initiative evidence.
Treat every unrelated pre-existing change as user-owned.

## Verification at handoff

- R04-01 self-executing test reports one pass, zero failures, and zero skips;
- Data.Backup source and focused test projects build with zero errors;
- runtime and consumer tests for R04-02 must cover repeat hosts and disposed-state negative paths;
- documentation metadata, links, TOC, privacy scan, and `git diff --check` pass;
- no private downstream detail enters evidence or examples.

## Do not infer

- Do not broaden R04-02 into package, bootstrap, explanation, or Entity-facet work.
- Do not migrate public Entity vocabulary before false-success and host-lifetime hazards are bounded.
- Do not use a passing source build to claim package installation is fixed.
- Do not accept a zero test-command exit code without a discovered/executed test count.
- Do not promote maturity until external clean-room and failure evidence earns it.
