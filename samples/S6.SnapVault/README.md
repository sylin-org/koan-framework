## What is SnapVault?

SnapVault is a **self-hosted photo management system** built with Koan Framework that rivals commercial solutions like Google Photos. It's not a toy example—it's a complete, production-ready application demonstrating:

✨ **AI Vision Analysis** - Vision models analyze photos and generate structured metadata (tags, summaries, compositional details)
🔍 **Semantic Search** - Natural language queries like "sunset at beach" or "people laughing"
🎨 **Modern Dark UI** - Professional gallery with keyboard shortcuts, accessibility, and responsive design
⚡ **Smart Processing** - Automatic generation of optimized derivatives (thumbnails, gallery views) with intelligent caching
📊 **Real-time Progress** - SignalR streams upload progress and processing status
💾 **Intelligent Storage** - Three-tier architecture (hot-cdn, warm, cold) optimizes costs and performance
📱 **Complete Features** - Favorites, ratings, bulk actions, drag-drop upload, event organization, timeline views

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Docker Desktop (manages MongoDB, Weaviate, Ollama automatically)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/koan-framework.git
cd koan-framework/samples/S6.SnapVault

# Run the start script (handles everything automatically)
./start.bat  # Windows
# or
./start.sh   # macOS/Linux
```

The script automatically:
1. Builds the Docker image
2. Starts all required services (MongoDB, Weaviate, Ollama)
3. Initializes the application
4. Opens your browser to http://localhost:5086

**That's it!** Upload photos, try semantic search, explore the lightbox.

## What You'll Learn

This sample demonstrates **production-ready Koan Framework patterns**:

### 🖼️ Media Processing (DX-0047 Fluent API)

Process images using declarative transformation pipelines with automatic resource management:

```csharp
// Create multiple derivatives efficiently with branching
var result = await photo.OpenRead().AutoOrient().ResizeFit(1200, 1200).Result();

var gallery = await result.Branch().Upload<PhotoGallery>("gallery.jpg");
var thumb = await result.Branch().CropSquare().ResizeFit(150, 150).Upload<PhotoThumbnail>();
var masonry = await result.Branch().ResizeFit(300, 300).Upload<PhotoMasonryThumbnail>();
```

**Why it matters**: Before DX-0047, this required ~80 lines of operator loops. The fluent API reduces it to 15 lines.

### 🤖 AI Integration (Vision + Embeddings)

Integrate AI vision models with structured JSON output and semantic search:

```csharp
// Vision analysis with anti-hallucination prompt engineering
var analysis = await Ai.Understand(new AiVisionOptions {
    ImageBytes = imageBytes,
    Prompt = structuredJsonPrompt,
    Model = "qwen2.5vl"
});

// Generate embeddings for semantic search
var embedding = await Ai.Embed(analysis.ToEmbeddingText());

// Hybrid search with user-controlled balance
var results = await Vector<PhotoAsset>.Search(
    vector: embedding,
    text: query,
    alpha: 0.5,  // 50% semantic, 50% keyword
    topK: 20
);
```

**Why it matters**: Shows real-world AI integration with graceful fallbacks and prompt refinement strategies.

### 💾 Multi-Tier Storage Architecture

Optimize storage costs with declarative tier assignment:

```csharp
// Full-resolution originals in cold storage
[StorageBinding(Profile = "cold", Container = "photos")]
public class PhotoAsset : MediaEntity<PhotoAsset> { }

// Gallery views in warm storage
[StorageBinding(Profile = "warm", Container = "gallery")]
public class PhotoGallery : MediaEntity<PhotoGallery> { }

// Thumbnails in CDN-backed hot storage
[StorageBinding(Profile = "hot-cdn", Container = "thumbnails")]
public class PhotoThumbnail : MediaEntity<PhotoThumbnail> { }
```

**Production mapping**: hot-cdn → CloudFront, warm → S3 Standard, cold → Glacier

### 📡 Real-Time Progress Tracking

Stream processing status to the browser with SignalR:

```csharp
// Backend: Emit progress events
await _hubContext.Clients.Group($"job:{jobId}").SendAsync("PhotoProgress", new {
    PhotoId = photo.Id,
    Stage = "ai-description",  // upload → exif → thumbnails → ai-description → completed
    Status = "processing"
});

// Frontend: Listen and update UI
connection.on('PhotoProgress', (event) => {
    updateProgressCard(event.photoId, event.stage);
});
```

**Why it matters**: Background processing with real-time feedback creates professional UX.

### 🎨 Modern Web Application

Production-quality frontend with vanilla JavaScript components:

- **Photo Grid**: Masonry layout with lazy loading, selection, quick actions
- **Lightbox**: Full-screen viewer with zoom, pan, keyboard navigation, accessibility
- **Unified Panel**: EXIF metadata, AI insights, and actions in one slide-out panel
- **Upload Modal**: Drag-drop with event selection and progress tracking
- **Search Bar**: Hybrid search with alpha slider (keyword ↔ semantic)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full navigation without mouse
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, focus management, screen reader support

**Why vanilla JS?** This sample focuses on backend patterns. Simple frontend means less learning curve.

## Architecture Highlights

### Entity-First Development

**Traditional approach**:
```csharp
// Repositories, services, layers of abstraction
public class PhotoRepository : IPhotoRepository { /* ... */ }
public class PhotoService : IPhotoService { /* ... */ }
```

**Koan approach**:
```csharp
// Entities are self-sufficient
var photo = await PhotoAsset.Get(id);
await photo.Save();
```

**Result**: Less infrastructure code, more focus on domain logic.

### Automatic API Generation

```csharp
// Inherit EntityController for automatic CRUD endpoints
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class PhotosController : EntityController<PhotoAsset>
{
    // GET, POST, PUT, DELETE provided automatically

    // Add custom endpoints for business logic
    [HttpPost("upload")]
    public async Task<ActionResult> Upload(...) { }
}
```

### Background Processing Pattern

```csharp
// 1. Create job for tracking
var job = new ProcessingJob { TotalPhotos = files.Count };
await job.Save();

// 2. Return immediately with job ID
return Ok(new { JobId = job.Id });

// 3. Process in background
_ = Task.Run(() => ProcessPhotos(files, job.Id));

// 4. Emit SignalR events for progress
await _hub.Clients.Group($"job:{job.Id}").SendAsync("PhotoProgress", ...);
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The start script creates a `.env` file automatically. For manual configuration:

```bash
# Data Provider
KOAN_DATA_PROVIDER=mongodb
KOAN_MONGODB_CONNECTION=mongodb://localhost:27017

# Vector Provider
KOAN_VECTOR_PROVIDER=weaviate
KOAN_WEAVIATE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080

# AI Provider
KOAN_AI_PROVIDER=ollama
KOAN_OLLAMA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434

# Storage
KOAN_STORAGE_PROVIDER=localfile
KOAN_STORAGE_BASEPATH=./.Koan/storage
```

### Storage Profiles

Configured in `Initialization/KoanAutoRegistrar.cs`:

```csharp
config.UseLocalFileStorage(opts => {
    opts.AddProfile("hot-cdn", profile => {
        profile.UseCache = true;
        profile.CacheMaxAge = TimeSpan.FromDays(30);
    });

    opts.AddProfile("warm", profile => {
        profile.UseCache = true;
        profile.CacheMaxAge = TimeSpan.FromDays(7);
    });

    opts.AddProfile("cold", profile => {
        profile.UseCache = false;
    });
});
```

**Production**: Replace with `UseS3Storage()` or `UseAzureBlobStorage()` and map profiles to appropriate tiers.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"AI analysis returns null"**
- Verify Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434`
- Check models are pulled: `ollama list` (should show `all-minilm`, `qwen2.5vl`)

**"Vector search not working"**
- Verify Weaviate is running: `curl http://localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready`
- Check browser console for errors during search

**"Upload stuck at processing"**
- Check SignalR connection in browser console
- Verify PhotoProcessingHub is registered in Program.cs
- Check server logs for background task exceptions

**"Images not displaying"**
- Verify `./.Koan/storage/` directory exists
- Check for `gallery/`, `thumbnails/` subdirectories
- Look for 404 errors in browser console

For detailed debugging, see [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting-guide).

## Performance Characteristics

**Upload Processing**:
- Batch upload of 100 photos: ~2-3 minutes (includes derivatives + AI analysis)
- Single photo processing: ~1-2 seconds (derivatives only)
- AI vision analysis: ~5-30 seconds per photo (depends on model)

**Search Performance**:
- Semantic search (1000 photos): <500ms
- Keyword search (1000 photos): <100ms
- Hybrid search with alpha slider: <500ms

**Storage Efficiency**:
- 1 full-resolution photo (12MP, ~4MB): → 4MB cold + 200KB warm + 10KB hot = ~4.21MB total
- Three-tier approach reduces CDN bandwidth costs by >95%
