{"originalText":"*Youâ€™re listening to **Tales in the Wind**.*  \n*Tonight: â€œThe Night I Didnâ€™t Take Her Firstborn,â€� narrated by Astrid.*\n\n# The Night I Didnâ€™t Take Her Firstborn\n\nI keep my ledgers on ribbon, not paperâ€”thin threads hung in a cold room where the walls remember each name. Fourteen hundred and twenty-six winters, eleven months, seven days. The ribbon hums when I touch it. The hum is for her.\n\nThe first time I found her she was curled around a fire like someone trying to wear smoke. Wind in the doorframe, old snow in the corners, the kind of hunger that stains fingers grey.\n\nMy kind does not starve. We just wait. Waiting is the only part of eternity that ever learned to speak.\n\nI offered the old bargain the way you offer a cup: steady, unspilled. Warmth for a price. â€œYour firstborn,â€� I said, the syllables folding like cloth. She didnâ€™t look at the fire. She looked at me, eyes still alight with a life I couldnâ€™t quite name. The ember crackled like a small laugh.\n\nâ€œFine,â€� she breathed. â€œIf the winter wants me, it can learn to ask.â€�\n\nWe never shook hands. We let the wind do it.\n\nYears turned like pages someone forgot to dog-ear. When I returnedâ€”roughly sixty of them laterâ€”she had hair like ash and paper-thin skin the color of old envelopes. My face was the same; time doesnâ€™t mark where it isnâ€™t invited. I wasnâ€™t angry; the ribbon had plenty of slack. I only asked the question a ledger asks a number.\n\nShe looked at me the way embers look at dawn and said, with a grin that tugged the stitches of the world: â€œHa! I offered you my firstborn, but Iâ€™m asexual.â€�  \nIt landed like a cherry pit in a porcelain bowlâ€”small, decisive, oddly joyful. Then she died, laughing.\n\nSome promises go quiet. This one grew shy and left the room.\n\nEight lives later, I had learned new words for old doors. Not having children wasnâ€™t a trick; it was a truth. The world had changed; only my ribbon hadnâ€™t. I began to feel like a cupboard full of cups no one wanted to use.\n\nStill, the ledger hummed, and I am older than reluctance.\n\nHer ninth return gathered itself like fog over a riverbank. She was not long in that body when the ribbon thrummed bright as kettle-steam. â€œNow,â€� it told me, like a breath you finally let go. I stepped through the small placesâ€”between a streetlamp and its halo, between a curtain and the open windowâ€”until I found her.\n\nShe couldnâ€™t have been much older than the first time, and yet there are kinds of tired that are age without number. The fire in her eyesâ€”a candle that had refused weather for centuriesâ€”was now a thin thread of orange. She was alone except for the bundle in her arms. Alone is not the right word; she and the bundle were a weather system together.\n\nShe saw me, and in her face I watched a hundred doorways close. She gathered the child closer, like someone lifting the only warm bowl in a house.\n\nI had words ready, old ones with edges worn smooth: â€œa deal is a deal,â€� â€œthe river keeps its banks,â€� â€œI donâ€™t take, I collect.â€� I had centuries to fall back on. Instead, a small sound happened in the roomâ€”soft, decisive. The child sighed.\n\nDo you know the noise dust makes when it begins to learn a letter? The way a page grows warmer under a lamp? Thatâ€™s how the sigh felt. A tiny home being declared.\n\nâ€œYou came,â€� she whispered.  \nâ€œI keep ledgers,â€� I said, but it came out like â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€�\n\nOutside, October pressed its face to the window. Somewhere a dog thumped its tailâ€”the old kind of welcome, the kind that remembers your footsteps before you choose them. The world, for once, did not breathe down my neck. It held still, as if it had agreed to let a moment finish itself.\n\nI stepped closer. The childâ€™s fingers had that newness that makes time blush. Not mine, I thought, and then startled at the honesty of it. We make contracts to save ourselves from honesty.\n\nâ€œWhat did you name them?â€� I asked.  \nShe laughed, a quiet, wet sound. â€œI didnâ€™t. Names stick too hard.â€� She pressed her nose to the childâ€™s hair. â€œWe hum.â€�\n\nI have no use for lullabies, but I understood humming. The ribbon on my wall hummed whenever I passed it, no matter how gently I walked.\n\nAll at once I remembered the first winter: the fire like a half-closed eye; the way her fingers tried to warm themselves on light; the sentence about the world asking. A bargain is a doorway; it is also a season. Some doors grow gardens around them if you leave them long enough.\n\nâ€œTake me, then,â€� she said, not lifting her eyes from the small face in her arms. â€œI donâ€™t know how to be in this world anymore without breaking. But I canâ€™t break away from this.â€�\n\nThere are nights when everything you know leans against the wall like a tired chair. The old lines, the old rules, the old hungerâ€”they donâ€™t disappear. They simply wait for a gentler grammar. I reachedâ€”slowly, as if the air had bonesâ€”and touched her wrist. Her pulse was a sparrow in a library.\n\nâ€œThe bargain,â€� I said, and my voice wore a scarf for the first time.  \nâ€œIt asked for your firstborn.â€�  \nâ€œAnd?â€� She looked up. There were centuries in her smile, and also laundry on a line, and also the smell of an orange in winter.  \nâ€œAnd you gave me yourself,â€� I said, and only heard how true it was after I spoke.\n\nIn that first snowed-in room, she had offered me her future and kept on living anyway. Across lives, she had kept giving me versions of her refusal, each one folded into the next. She had paid with her attention. She had paid with her laughter. She had paid with the kind of stubborn hope that keeps tea warm just a little longer than it should be.\n\nThe childâ€™s hand loosened against her coat. Their breath found a rhythm Iâ€™d met on ferry decks and in stairwells where someone was practicing a simple song. Suddenly, the arithmetic was easy.\n\nâ€œI wonâ€™t take what warms you,â€� I said. â€œNot now. Not ever.â€�\n\nThe ribbon behind my ribsâ€”a ledger only I could feelâ€”went slack. In my room of threads, a knot untied itself like a sigh you hadnâ€™t realized you were clenching. Somewhere, a kettle clicked as it cooled.\n\nShe didnâ€™t thank me. She didnâ€™t need to. Gratitude has a way of turning true things into favors, and I am not a favor.\n\nâ€œCome,â€� I said, and the word folded the window open.\n\nWe stepped out into the night as if it were a hallway weâ€™d both lived in beforeâ€”a familiar draft, a board that creaks in the good place, a streetlamp that minds its own halo. Leaves kept their breath. A thin moon wore a coat of cloud. The world had set the table and left the room.\n\nI took her hand, the small one between us tucked into my other palm. Two heartbeats found mine and, like careful harmonies, stayed just behind. We kept to the edges where our kind walks: the seam between brick and ivy, the gap between two panes of glass, the line where tide decides. Field mice stopped arguing. The air learned our names without needing to say them.\n\nOn the last lean of the last street, the city tilted into the space my world keeps for arrivals. It isnâ€™t a palace; itâ€™s not even a forest. Itâ€™s a room that always smells a bit like sea and old wood, with a window that opens itself, a kettle that never boils dry, a ribbon on the wall that hums softly so no one feels too new.\n\nShe sat. The child slept deeper, mouth ajar as if letting go of the last bite of daylight. I lit no candles; the dark didnâ€™t feel the need to be dramatic. It leaned a little, like a friend looking in through the kitchen door.\n\nâ€œWe donâ€™tâ€¦ owe,â€� she murmured, half under. â€œWe justâ€¦ stay?â€�  \nI considered my ledger. The thread that had hummed for fourteen hundred and twenty-six winters now lay quiet, like a map you finally trust enough to fold away. I reached up, untied it, and let it rest in a bowl with other threads that once learned a softer ending.\n\nâ€œYou donâ€™t owe,â€� I said. â€œYouâ€™re owed. Time owes you rest. Rooms owe you warmth. And Iâ€”â€� I paused, surprised by the shape of the next words. â€œI owe you company.â€�\n\nShe smiled without waking. The child made a tiny sound, the kind that tells you everyone in the room has agreed to the same story.\n\nIn the morningâ€”because yes, even in my house there is morningâ€”light will tiptoe through the window and find three cups set out, one large, one smaller, one that will not be used yet. The kettle will hum.\n\nSomewhere outside, ivy will practice letting go of rain.  \nI will not take her firstborn.  \nI will not take anything.  \nI will keep a quiet ledger of small proofs instead: a cooled cup that means someone slept; a whispered lullaby that means someone learned the room; the warmth that lingers in a chair after you stand.\n\nOn some other October, the wind will put its ear to my door, listening.  \nIâ€™ll let it.  \nItâ€™s earned a story too.\n\n*This has been **Tales in the Wind**. Thank you for listening. Good night.*","translatedText":"\"The Night I Didn't Take Her Firstborn\"\n\nI keep my records on ribbon, not paper-thin threads hung in a cold room where the walls remember each name.

THE CHILD'S FINGERS HAD THAT NEWNESS THAT MAKES TIME BLUSH. NOT MINE, I THOUGHT, AND THEN SURPRISED AT HOW TRUE IT WAS. WE MAKE CONTRACTS TO SAVE OURSELVES FROM HONESTY.\n\nELLA RIBAÓ LA LLAMA ININSTANTANEOUSLY, UN LIKE A QUIET, WET SOUND. SHE PRESSÉD HER NOSE TO THE CHILD'S HAIR. \"WE HUM.\"\n\nIO APRENDEDO QUE NO UTILIZO LLAMAS, BUT I UNDERSTOOD HUMMING. EL RIBBON ON MY WALL HUMMED EVERY TIME I PASSED IT, NO MATTER HOW GENTLY I WALKED.\n\nEMERGECIDamente, REMEMBERED THE FIRST WINTER: LA LUCHA LIKE A HALF-CLOSED EYE; la formas de sus manos intentando calentarse con la luz; EL SENTENCE ABOUT THE WORLD ASKING. UNA ACUÑANZA ES UNA PUERTA; also, una estación. Algunas puertas crecen jardines alrededor de ellas si dejas tiempo lo suficientemente.\n\n\"¿CUALQUIER nombres?\" Ella asked. \"NO,\" I THOUGHT, AND THEN SURPRISED AGAIN BY HOW TRUE IT WAS. THE NAMES STICK TOO HARD.\n\nELla LAUGHED, A QUIET, WET SOUND. \"I DIDN'T.\" SHE PRESSED HER NOSE TO THE CHILD'S HAIR. \"WE HUM.\"\n\n\"TAKE ME,\" ELla SAID, NOT LIFTING HER EYES FROM THE SMALL FACE IN HER ARMS. \"I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE IN THIS WORLD ANYMORE WITHOUT BREAKING. BUT I CAN'T BREAK AWAY FROM THIS.\"\n\nHay NIGHTS when everything you know leans against the wall like a tired chair. The old lines, the old rules, the old hunger - they don't disappear. They simply wait for a gentler grammar. REACHED - SLOWLY, AS IF THE AIR HAD BONES - AND TOUCHED HER WRIST. Her pulse was like a sparrow in a library.\n\n\"THE CONTRACT,\" I SAID, AND MY VOICE WORE A SCARF FOR THE FIRST TIME. \"IT ASKED FOR YOUR FIRSTBORN.\"\n\n\"AND?\" Ella LOOKED UP. THERE WERE CENTURIES IN HER SMILE, AND ALSO LAUNDRY ON A LINE, AND ALSO EL SMELL OF AN ORANGE IN WINTER.\n\n\"YOU GAVE ME YOURSELF,\" I SAID, AND ONLY HEARD HOW TRUE IT WAS AFTER I SPOKE.\n\nEN THAT FIRST SNOWED-IN ROOM, she had offered me her future and kept on living anyway. ACROSS LIVES, SHE HAD KEPT GIVING ME VERSIONS OF HER REFUSAL, EACH ONE FOLDED INTO THE NEXT. She had paid with her attention. She had paid with her laughter. She had paid with the kind of stubborn hope that keeps tea warm just a little longer than it should be.\n\nTHE CHILD'S HAND LOOSED AGAINST HER COAT. Their breath found a rhythm I'd met on ferry decks and in stairwells where someone was practicing a simple song. SUDDENLY, THE ARITHMETIC WAS EASY.\n\n\"I WON'T TAKE WHAT WARMS YOU,\" I SAID. \"NOT NOW. NOT EVER.\"\n\nEl ribbon behind my ribs - a ledger only I could feel - went slack. In my room of threads, a knot untied itself like a sigh you hadn't realized you were clenching. Somewhere, a kettle clicked as it cooled.\n\nSHE DIDN'T THANK ME. She didn't need to. GRATITUDE HAS A WAY OF TURNING TRUE THINGS INTO FAVORS, AND I AM NOT A FAVOR.\n\n\"COME,\" I SAID, AND THE WORD FOLDED THE WINDOW OPEN.\n\nWE STEPPED OUT INTO THE NIGHT AS IF IT WERE A HALLWAY WE'D BOTH LIVED IN BEFORE - A FAMILIAR DRAFT, A BOARD THAT CLENCHS IN THE GOOD PLACE, A STREETLAMP THAT MINDS ITS OWN HALO. LEAVES KEPT THEIR BREATH. A THIN MOON WORE A COAT OF CLOUD. THE WORLD HAD SET THE TABLE AND LEFT THE ROOM.\n\nI TOOK HER HAND, the small one between us tucked into my other palm. TWO HEARTBEATS FOUND MINE AND, LIKE CAREFUL HARMONIES, STAYED JUST BEHIND. WE KEPT TO THE EDGES WHERE OUR KIND WALKS - THE SEAM BETWEEN BRICK AND IVY, THE GAP BETWEEN TWO PANES OF GLASS, THE LINE WHERE TIDE DECIDES. Field mice stopped arguing. The air learned our names without needing to say them.\n\nON THE LAST LEAN OF THE LAST STREET, THE CITY TILTED INTO THE SPACE MY WORLD KEEPS FOR ARRIVALS. IT ISN'T A PALACE; it isn't even a forest.

Reaching up, untied it and let it rest in a bowl with other threads that once learned a softer ending.\n\n\"You don't owe anyone anything,\" I said. \"You are owed. Time owes you rest.
