    "instructions": "As a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Security Engineer, or Compliance Officer at your organization, you are required to conduct a thorough security and compliance assessment of your systems and applications. This analysis aims to identify potential vulnerabilities, evaluate adherence to relevant regulations, and propose actionable security enhancements.\n\n### Role Context:\nYou are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your organization's information assets. This assessment will help you understand the current security posture and compliance status of your systems and applications, enabling informed decision-making regarding resource allocation and risk mitigation.\n\n### Intended Audience:\nThis analysis is intended for CISOs, Security Engineers, and Compliance Officers who need a detailed understanding of their organization's security and compliance landscape to prioritize improvements and allocate resources effectively.\n\n### Specific Extraction Criteria:\n1. **Document Title** (snake_case: `document_title`): Extract the title of the provided document, which could be a security scan report or compliance checklist.\n2. **Review Date** (snake_case: `review_date`): Identify and extract the date when the assessment was conducted or the document was last updated.\n3. **Executive Summary** (snake_case: `executive_summary`): Summarize the key findings, risks, and recommendations in a concise manner suitable for high-level stakeholders.\n4. **Key Findings** (snake_case: `key_findings`): List and describe major vulnerabilities or compliance gaps identified during the assessment.\n5. **Recommendations** (snake_case: `recommendations`): Provide detailed, actionable suggestions to address each vulnerability or compliance gap.\n6. **Contextual Information** (snake_case: `contextual_info`): Include relevant background details about the systems and applications under review, such as their purpose, data handled, and interconnections.\n7. **Risk Assessment** (snake_case: `risk_assessment`): Evaluate the severity and potential impact of each vulnerability or compliance issue.\n8. **Remediation Priorities** (snake_case: `remediation_priorities`): Rank issues based on their criticality and propose a phased approach for addressing them.\n9. **Metadata** (snake_case: `metadata`): Capture additional information like the assessor's name, assessment tools used, and any limitations encountered during the analysis.\n\n### Quality Expectations:\n- Ensure all fields are populated with accurate and relevant data.\n- Use clear, unambiguous language in descriptions and recommendations.\n- Format tables and lists for readability.\n- Maintain consistency in naming conventions and capitalization.\n\n### Formatting Guidance:\n- Use markdown format with semantic sections (## Section Name).\n- Employ Mustache syntax {{field_name}} to match field names exactly within the template.\n- Group related fields into logical sections for clarity.\n- Utilize tables, lists, and formatting to enhance readability.",
