# UX Documentation Archive

**Status**: ⚠️ ARCHIVED - Historical Reference Only

---

## Notice

This folder contains **superseded UX documentation** from earlier design iterations. These documents are preserved for historical reference but **should not be used for implementation**.

### What Happened

These documents represented exploration and iteration phases:
- **prop2**: Living Analysis concept exploration (valuable ideas, now integrated)
- **00-04 series**: Early UX proposal iterations (superseded)
- **Component/layout specs**: Replaced by canonical specification

### Current Authority

**All UX decisions should reference:**

👉 **`docs/UX-SPECIFICATION.md`** ← THE CANONICAL UX NORTH STAR

This is the approved, authoritative user experience specification that synthesizes:
- Living Analysis paradigm (from prop2)
- Evidence-first architecture (from Meridian core)
- Authoritative Notes pattern (from technical spec)
- Koan Framework philosophical alignment
